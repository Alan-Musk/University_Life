Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.20,0:00:03.76,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this is the lecture 11 q a
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.76,0:00:06.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and the first question was what is an
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.00,0:00:07.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction barrier
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.92,0:00:10.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,they turned out to be like one of the
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.08,0:00:11.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,more important concepts
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.60,0:00:15.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in this course so
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.04,0:00:16.80,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i get emails once in a while from
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.80,0:00:18.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,students
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.24,0:00:20.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,who say like oh i just took the
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.96,0:00:22.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,operating systems
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.24,0:00:25.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,course 162 and i never would have
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.44,0:00:27.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,survived that huge project except that i
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.44,0:00:28.32,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,remembered about
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.32,0:00:30.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction barriers and so i was able
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.64,0:00:31.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to build it so
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.68,0:00:34.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this is a concept that's very important
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.00,0:00:36.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,for building large programs
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.88,0:00:38.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,which is quite different than what we've
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.24,0:00:39.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,done in this course i mean actually your
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.92,0:00:42.80,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,projects are pretty large but
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.80,0:00:44.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but eventually you want to build really
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.64,0:00:46.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,large applications
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.00,0:00:47.76,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and the only way to make those
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.76,0:00:50.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,manageable is to use abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.00,0:00:51.52,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,barriers because then you can change
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.52,0:00:52.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,parts without having to change other
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.88,0:00:53.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,parts
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.44,0:00:55.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you can think about one thing at a time
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.44,0:00:57.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you don't have to kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.04,0:00:58.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,understand everything and how it
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.48,0:01:00.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,interacts all at once in order to make
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.15,0:01:01.52,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,progress
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.52,0:01:03.28,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so the idea behind an abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.28,0:01:05.28,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,barrier is that
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.28,0:01:08.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you choose how you're going to describe
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.87,0:01:10.56,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,some computation
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.56,0:01:13.76,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,using some particular set of names
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.76,0:01:16.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,or functions in this case because uh all
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.87,0:01:19.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of our names refer to either values
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.20,0:01:21.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,or functions and functions actually do
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.12,0:01:22.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.31,0:01:25.28,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so the story would be that when you're
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.28,0:01:26.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like doing
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.00,0:01:28.23,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,something like performing some big
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.23,0:01:29.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,computation
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.36,0:01:33.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you only use uh these operations here
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.36,0:01:35.28,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in order to do it that you want to add
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.28,0:01:37.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rationals together figure out whether
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.04,0:01:38.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rationals are equal
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.40,0:01:40.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if you're working with rational numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.48,0:01:41.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,without ever
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.51,0:01:43.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like doing anything with the
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.44,0:01:45.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,representation of rational numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.44,0:01:48.95,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like uh inspecting their components
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.95,0:01:50.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the reason you do this is so that all
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.87,0:01:52.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that code you wrote in order to perform
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.64,0:01:54.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a big computation of like uh
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.87,0:01:56.95,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you know the weather system or the air
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.95,0:02:00.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,quality forecast or whatever
Dialogue: 0,0:02:00.15,0:02:02.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,doesn't need to change at all if later
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.64,0:02:04.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you decide to change the way in which
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.48,0:02:06.71,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you're representing numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.71,0:02:07.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and this is true not just of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.92,0:02:09.52,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,representing numbers but representing
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.52,0:02:11.28,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,anything if you want to like
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.28,0:02:13.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,build a system that crawls the web
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.36,0:02:16.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,looking for like interesting web pages
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.08,0:02:18.56,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you want to build that in terms of a set
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.56,0:02:20.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of functions that describes how to get
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.24,0:02:22.47,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the parts of a web page that doesn't
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.47,0:02:23.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,assume that you know
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.75,0:02:26.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the internal data representation of that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.24,0:02:28.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,web page which might change over time
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.40,0:02:30.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so uh you know that's basically the
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.31,0:02:31.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,story is that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.59,0:02:33.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,when you write part of your program you
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.84,0:02:35.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,say in advance
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.03,0:02:36.80,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,oh i'm going to write it in terms of
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.80,0:02:38.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,these basic operations
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.31,0:02:41.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and then use those basic operations and
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.59,0:02:43.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and those basic operations then need to
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.75,0:02:45.52,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,be implemented somehow and that is the
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.52,0:02:46.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,next
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.31,0:02:49.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,layer below the abstraction barrier is
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.36,0:02:50.56,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that you describe
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.56,0:02:53.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,how to add rationals or multiply
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.12,0:02:55.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rationals or whatever
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.44,0:02:58.47,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so you're basically parts of the program
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.47,0:02:59.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that implement
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.84,0:03:01.52,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the things that you're using in the
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.52,0:03:03.28,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,higher layer also
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.28,0:03:06.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,need to be built out of a fixed set of
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.08,0:03:07.52,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,components in this case
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.52,0:03:09.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,functions that get the numerator and the
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.12,0:03:10.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,denominator because you can't
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.87,0:03:12.56,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,add things unless you know how to get
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.56,0:03:14.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,their parts so
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.24,0:03:17.19,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um yeah i hope that wasn't too
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.19,0:03:19.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,long-winded but the story is
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.12,0:03:21.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,break apart your large program into
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.68,0:03:22.56,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,pieces
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.56,0:03:25.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that don't depend on how the other parts
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.36,0:03:26.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,are implemented
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.87,0:03:28.80,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,let me let me add a couple things i i
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.80,0:03:30.47,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like that last bit i think that was
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.47,0:03:31.91,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,exactly right so let me add a few things
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.91,0:03:32.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so first of all
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.96,0:03:34.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction barriers are somewhat
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.87,0:03:36.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstract and
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.16,0:03:37.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it's it's going to be hard to know
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.59,0:03:40.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,exactly where to draw those lines until
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.24,0:03:42.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you start writing code and then you
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.63,0:03:43.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,realize
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.44,0:03:45.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,oh i made a change over here that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.36,0:03:46.80,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,trickled down
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.80,0:03:48.56,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and i had to go through ten thousand
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.56,0:03:50.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,lines of code to make some changes which
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.00,0:03:51.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,means you violated
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.36,0:03:52.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,an abstraction barrier and that's you
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.96,0:03:54.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,sort of learn by making these mistakes
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.63,0:03:55.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that's number one
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.84,0:03:58.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,number two is abstraction barriers are
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.08,0:04:00.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,built on the concept that code is not
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.08,0:04:02.71,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,static it's constantly changing there's
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.71,0:04:03.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,no notion of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.84,0:04:05.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you write something and then you go home
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.75,0:04:07.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and that thing runs for the next 10
Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.36,0:04:08.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,years and
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.31,0:04:11.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,code is constantly changing and because
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.36,0:04:12.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.31,0:04:15.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you want to isolate the impact of change
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.59,0:04:17.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah so imagine an automobile think
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.36,0:04:18.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about all the complexity of an
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.87,0:04:20.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,automobile the wheels
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.48,0:04:23.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the chassis the engine and imagine a
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.12,0:04:23.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,world where
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.92,0:04:25.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you decide you're going to make a change
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.04,0:04:27.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to the windshield wipers and now you
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.27,0:04:28.80,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,gotta change you gotta make a change in
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.80,0:04:30.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the carburetor
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.72,0:04:33.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,because of that so you wanna isolate
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.04,0:04:34.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,where
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.00,0:04:36.80,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,change impacts and that's this notion of
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.80,0:04:38.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction barriers that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.39,0:04:41.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if i make a change in one of these rows
Dialogue: 0,0:04:41.04,0:04:42.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,here there's no
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.48,0:04:44.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,ripple effect down to the rest of the
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.63,0:04:45.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,code
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.92,0:04:47.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and that makes it easier to make changes
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.51,0:04:49.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and to of course debug
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.04,0:04:50.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and now the question you want to ask is
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.24,0:04:51.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,well how do i know where to draw those
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.68,0:04:52.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,lines
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.72,0:04:54.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and that's where it takes a little bit
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.16,0:04:56.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of time and experience and you'll see
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.48,0:04:58.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,where we draw those abstraction barriers
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.31,0:05:00.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to make sure we hide things
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.00,0:05:03.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,from other parts of the code a follow-up
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.51,0:05:04.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,question was
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.48,0:05:07.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if you make a change to one layer in
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.12,0:05:08.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this picture
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.07,0:05:10.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,does that affect all the layers above or
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.07,0:05:13.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,all the layers below
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.27,0:05:15.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it depends how you make that change
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.12,0:05:16.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,there are many changes that happen
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.87,0:05:20.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in within a layer that
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.00,0:05:23.19,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,won't affect any other layer

Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.63,0:05:29.19,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,names of the rational operations
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.19,0:05:32.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and you don't change how they're being
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.00,0:05:32.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.31,0:05:35.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the basic components all you do for
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.12,0:05:35.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,example
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.92,0:05:39.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is now store the numerator and
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.44,0:05:40.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,denominator
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.24,0:05:44.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in terms of uh like terms by
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.00,0:05:47.19,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like applying a gcd uh every time you
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.19,0:05:50.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh perform addition that change could
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.07,0:05:51.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,actually be isolated at just one
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.68,0:05:53.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,particular layer
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.44,0:05:55.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and not have not require you to make any
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.51,0:05:57.19,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,changes to the code that implements all
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.19,0:05:58.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.16,0:06:00.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and not require any changes to the code
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.24,0:06:01.43,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,down here so
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.43,0:06:04.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that's the ideal sometimes a change will
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.16,0:06:05.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,require
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.36,0:06:07.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you to edit something above or below if
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.83,0:06:09.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you've sort of changed the name of add
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.83,0:06:11.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational then you're going to have to
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.04,0:06:12.56,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,change everything that calls that
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.56,0:06:13.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational to
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.36,0:06:17.19,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,use the new name but
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.19,0:06:19.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but many changes will be limited in
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.60,0:06:20.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,their scope to just
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.87,0:06:24.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,one uh layer meaning it won't
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.00,0:06:26.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,cross either abstraction barrier above
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.39,0:06:27.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,or below
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.75,0:06:29.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so there's a couple questions in the
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.12,0:06:30.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,chat so let me just read them and then
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.48,0:06:31.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,we'll see if we can answer them so as
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.83,0:06:33.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you go down the chart the function
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.36,0:06:34.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,should be simpler
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.72,0:06:37.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,not necessarily you can have incredible
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.12,0:06:38.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,complexity
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.39,0:06:40.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in the implementation of a list hide
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.72,0:06:41.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that from me
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.75,0:06:44.80,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and i can use a list and i don't care so
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.80,0:06:45.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.36,0:06:47.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the hierarchy here isn't really about
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.04,0:06:49.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,complexity it's just about
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.12,0:06:51.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,layers of abstraction and how you're
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.04,0:06:52.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,doing things
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.31,0:06:54.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,exactly like we talked about
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.00,0:06:55.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,dictionaries in this class
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.83,0:06:57.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the implementation of dictionaries
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.51,0:06:59.19,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,actually changed quite recently
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.19,0:07:02.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in python but no python code had to
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.87,0:07:04.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,change as a result because all the
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.63,0:07:06.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,python code that you write
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.00,0:07:08.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is above the abstraction layer that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.48,0:07:09.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,separates
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.27,0:07:11.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the language from its interpreter the
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.51,0:07:13.43,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,interpreter did change like the way in
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.43,0:07:14.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,which
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.00,0:07:15.43,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you know what is a dictionary is it a
Dialogue: 0,0:07:15.43,0:07:17.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,list of key value pairs is it something
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.27,0:07:19.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,else well you'll learn all about it
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.27,0:07:21.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in 61b but actually i'm not sure that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.83,0:07:24.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,even in 61b you'll learn all the details
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.00,0:07:25.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of what goes into a modern python
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.83,0:07:27.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,dictionary i mean it's quite a
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.04,0:07:29.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,complicated data structure
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.12,0:07:31.43,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but it was edited and changed without
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.43,0:07:33.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,really affecting any python programs
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.51,0:07:35.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,because there was something complicated
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.60,0:07:37.19,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but sometimes the program you write that
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.19,0:07:39.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uses a dictionary can be very simple
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.92,0:07:41.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,okay next question in the chat and we'll
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.83,0:07:43.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i'm sorry we'll get back to the i think
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.04,0:07:44.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,we have plenty of time we'll get back to
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.16,0:07:45.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the hands raising a second but these are
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.68,0:07:47.04,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,good questions um how do constructors
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.04,0:07:48.80,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and selectors come into play
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.80,0:07:50.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so what constructors and selectors
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.39,0:07:52.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,they're just a level of abstraction so
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.00,0:07:53.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,let's talk about a selector
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.44,0:07:55.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the selector says give me the numerator
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.75,0:07:57.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and then you don't have to worry about
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.51,0:07:59.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that it's represented as a pair as a
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.12,0:08:00.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,list and get the zeroth element so the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.87,0:08:02.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selectors
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.07,0:08:03.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,are a way of abstracting out the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.92,0:08:06.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,underlying data implementation by saying
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.24,0:08:07.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,look here's a function call
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.75,0:08:09.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this function call hands you back this
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.60,0:08:11.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,part of the data it's none of your
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.27,0:08:12.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,goddamn business
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.00,0:08:13.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,how i implemented it just ask me for
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.92,0:08:15.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,what you want and i will give it to you
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.27,0:08:16.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and that's that's what the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.07,0:08:17.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selector does and it's also what a
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.60,0:08:19.43,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,constructor does you give the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.43,0:08:21.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,constructor numbers and it builds the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.12,0:08:22.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,data type without you knowing
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.87,0:08:23.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,necessarily
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.92,0:08:25.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that it's implemented as a pair or a
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.83,0:08:28.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,tuple or a list or whatever
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.07,0:08:29.43,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so that's sort of the goal of those
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.43,0:08:31.43,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,functions is the function
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.43,0:08:33.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,themselves abstract out the underlying
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.84,0:08:36.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,data type
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.15,0:08:38.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah in this picture the group of names
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.55,0:08:40.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that's over here on the right in the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.08,0:08:41.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,using column
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.67,0:08:46.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,kind of describes the barrier just below
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.15,0:08:49.91,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and we'll see here there's an example of
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.91,0:08:51.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,just selectors and constructors being
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.75,0:08:52.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the names
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.63,0:08:55.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that are describing this barrier so
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.60,0:08:57.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that's just one way to create an
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.20,0:08:58.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction barrier is to use
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.72,0:09:00.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,data abstraction constructors and
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.39,0:09:02.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selectors and together
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.15,0:09:03.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,they describe how you're going to
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.67,0:09:05.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,separate
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.67,0:09:08.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,creating some values and operating on
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.79,0:09:09.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,them
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.36,0:09:12.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,from how you represent those values
Dialogue: 0,0:09:12.08,0:09:13.91,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,using something else
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.91,0:09:15.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but it's not the only way to create an
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.36,0:09:17.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction barrier you could also do it
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.27,0:09:19.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,by just like any collection of functions
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.03,0:09:21.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that you describe
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.03,0:09:22.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh even if we change the implementation
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.55,0:09:24.32,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of a function should the arguments
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.32,0:09:25.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,always stay the same as this function
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.75,0:09:26.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,would be called another layer this is a
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.96,0:09:28.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,really good question so
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.55,0:09:31.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,ideally yes that's sort of what you want
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.27,0:09:32.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um now every once in a while
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.87,0:09:34.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you know things just something really
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.72,0:09:36.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,complicated happens and you
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.87,0:09:38.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you have to make a change to the
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.72,0:09:40.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,parameters being called and then you've
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.24,0:09:41.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,got to ripple
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.12,0:09:44.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you know trickle that up or down
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.87,0:09:47.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the extraction barriers but ideally yes
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.67,0:09:48.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,when you make a change in one of these
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.96,0:09:50.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rows nothing should change but you know
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.63,0:09:52.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,we're also aware that sometimes
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.39,0:09:54.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you add a huge amount of complexity or
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.15,0:09:55.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,something really radical changes in
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.51,0:09:56.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,which case you're going to have to deal
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.55,0:09:57.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,with that
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.03,0:09:58.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,sometimes you will have to break through
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.72,0:10:00.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,those barriers
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.55,0:10:03.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah exactly and your barrier stable in
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.44,0:10:04.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a way
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.00,0:10:06.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if your function signatures stay the
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.48,0:10:07.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,same so that's the name
Dialogue: 0,0:10:07.67,0:10:09.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,plus the set of arguments that they take
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.44,0:10:11.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that's the whole signature of a function
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.36,0:10:13.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,basically the whole def line uh and if
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.75,0:10:15.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that stays the same then you're you can
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.36,0:10:16.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,make change below without
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.72,0:10:19.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,affecting anything above uh this is just
Dialogue: 0,0:10:19.60,0:10:20.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a very specific question about
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.72,0:10:21.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,dictionaries
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.36,0:10:23.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,for dictionaries do all the keys have to
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.12,0:10:25.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,be one data type and all the values be
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.03,0:10:26.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,one data type
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.39,0:10:29.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um so the i'm not sure about the latest
Dialogue: 0,0:10:29.44,0:10:30.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh dictionaries in python i don't
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.72,0:10:32.32,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,believe they do right certainly
Dialogue: 0,0:10:32.32,0:10:36.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the values can be any data type you want
Dialogue: 0,0:10:36.15,0:10:37.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and the keys also well they can't be
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.84,0:10:39.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,lists of course but they can be
Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.75,0:10:42.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,integers or strings yeah yeah you can
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.08,0:10:43.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,have a mix of different
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.36,0:10:47.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh types so it's very flexible in that
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.03,0:10:47.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,way
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.36,0:10:48.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah and by the way lists are the same
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.87,0:10:50.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,way obviously the the key
Dialogue: 0,0:10:50.72,0:10:53.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in in a list is just the integer 0 1 2 3
Dialogue: 0,0:10:53.44,0:10:54.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,4
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.08,0:10:56.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but the values in a list can be
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.24,0:10:58.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,arbitrary right you can have a list of
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.24,0:11:00.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a mixture of strings and integers and
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.15,0:11:02.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,lists and lists of lists and objects and
Dialogue: 0,0:11:02.24,0:11:03.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,blah blah blah
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.51,0:11:05.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so the dictionaries are just even a
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.44,0:11:06.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,little bit more general because you can
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.79,0:11:09.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,index on anything
Dialogue: 0,0:11:09.60,0:11:12.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,another follow-up question was does data
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.08,0:11:13.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction only apply to rational
Dialogue: 0,0:11:13.84,0:11:15.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,numbers or is this something more
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.12,0:11:16.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,general
Dialogue: 0,0:11:16.87,0:11:18.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that's just one example we're going to
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.24,0:11:20.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,be doing a lot of examples of data
Dialogue: 0,0:11:20.00,0:11:21.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction that was just a particularly
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.67,0:11:23.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,nice example of how you can hide certain
Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.67,0:11:26.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,implementation details from the user
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.55,0:11:30.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah good question so um
Dialogue: 0,0:11:30.08,0:11:32.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the question is how would you convert a
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.87,0:11:34.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational that you've created using
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.87,0:11:38.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this data abstraction to a
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.00,0:11:40.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,float value so that you could perform
Dialogue: 0,0:11:40.96,0:11:42.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,whatever mathematics you want
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.63,0:11:46.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,using the float um
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.03,0:11:48.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and where do you have to be careful
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.63,0:11:51.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about violating abstraction barriers
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.12,0:11:53.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i think a good way to handle this case
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.67,0:11:55.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,would be that once you have your
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.44,0:11:57.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational implementation that we talked
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.27,0:11:58.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.48,0:12:03.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,from lecture which does whatever it does
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.63,0:12:08.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you would write another function which
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.87,0:12:10.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is part of the description of how to
Dialogue: 0,0:12:10.55,0:12:12.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,manipulate rational numbers which
Dialogue: 0,0:12:12.24,0:12:13.91,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,converts it into a float that would be a
Dialogue: 0,0:12:13.91,0:12:16.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,fine way to do it so
Dialogue: 0,0:12:16.63,0:12:19.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if this is
Dialogue: 0,0:12:20.72,0:12:25.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,our abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:12:28.00,0:12:30.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh we could write a rational to float
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.24,0:12:31.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,function
Dialogue: 0,0:12:31.36,0:12:34.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,which returns the numerator of r
Dialogue: 0,0:12:34.63,0:12:39.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,divided by the denominator of r
Dialogue: 0,0:12:39.67,0:12:43.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and you know where is this
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.03,0:12:46.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in the like uh layers that we developed
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.55,0:12:48.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,well i think this is actually
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.72,0:12:52.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,part of the like manipulation
Dialogue: 0,0:12:52.00,0:12:54.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of rational numbers the same place where
Dialogue: 0,0:12:54.39,0:12:55.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,ad rational
Dialogue: 0,0:12:55.27,0:12:58.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is where in order to
Dialogue: 0,0:12:58.39,0:13:00.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.12,0:13:04.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in order to convert this into a float
Dialogue: 0,0:13:04.96,0:13:07.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you have to have access to its numerator
Dialogue: 0,0:13:07.20,0:13:08.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and its denominator you can't just
Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.55,0:13:08.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,create
Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.96,0:13:10.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,think of it as a whole object you have
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.48,0:13:12.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to think of it as parts
Dialogue: 0,0:13:12.08,0:13:13.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but you don't have to know how those
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.60,0:13:15.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,parts are bundled together
Dialogue: 0,0:13:15.36,0:13:17.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you just have to know that those parts
Dialogue: 0,0:13:17.67,0:13:18.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,exist and then
Dialogue: 0,0:13:18.72,0:13:20.32,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that they give you back numbers and
Dialogue: 0,0:13:20.32,0:13:22.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,those numbers can be divided
Dialogue: 0,0:13:22.87,0:13:26.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so um yeah if there's like three parts
Dialogue: 0,0:13:26.00,0:13:27.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of the program you have your
Dialogue: 0,0:13:27.84,0:13:31.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh data abstraction you have your
Dialogue: 0,0:13:31.12,0:13:33.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,operations on that data and then you
Dialogue: 0,0:13:33.51,0:13:35.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,have your
Dialogue: 0,0:13:35.36,0:13:37.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you know weather simulation or whatever
Dialogue: 0,0:13:37.12,0:13:39.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is down here
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.84,0:13:43.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um that is based on rational numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.36,0:13:45.91,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i think that converting to a float would
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.91,0:13:47.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,be in here somewhere as yet another
Dialogue: 0,0:13:47.67,0:13:49.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,operation that you might apply to
Dialogue: 0,0:13:49.44,0:13:50.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:13:50.79,0:13:52.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah i think that's exactly right notice
Dialogue: 0,0:13:52.55,0:13:54.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a couple of things notice that the
Dialogue: 0,0:13:54.15,0:13:54.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,function
Dialogue: 0,0:13:54.79,0:13:57.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational to float does not access r
Dialogue: 0,0:13:57.51,0:14:00.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,using r sub zero and r sub one it uses
Dialogue: 0,0:14:00.08,0:14:01.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the selector
Dialogue: 0,0:14:01.20,0:14:04.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,functions because it's across a barrier
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.72,0:14:06.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,right so even though it sort of knows
Dialogue: 0,0:14:06.48,0:14:08.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,what it's doing that's a no no because
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.63,0:14:09.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if we change the
Dialogue: 0,0:14:09.75,0:14:11.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,representation up at the very top here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:11.67,0:14:13.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,we don't want it to trickle down that's
Dialogue: 0,0:14:13.12,0:14:14.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,number one
Dialogue: 0,0:14:14.15,0:14:17.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and number two to uh the question is
Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.20,0:14:19.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if you want to create functionality for
Dialogue: 0,0:14:19.12,0:14:20.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rationals do it
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.55,0:14:22.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,add that functionality i can add
Dialogue: 0,0:14:22.00,0:14:23.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rationals i can multiply rationals
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.84,0:14:25.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i can now convert it to return to a
Dialogue: 0,0:14:25.60,0:14:27.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,float and build it
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.03,0:14:28.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,into your think of it as a library
Dialogue: 0,0:14:28.87,0:14:30.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you're building a library for
Dialogue: 0,0:14:30.48,0:14:32.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,manipulating in this case rational
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.08,0:14:32.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.96,0:14:34.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i need something to represent them i
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.39,0:14:36.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,need something to manipulate them and
Dialogue: 0,0:14:36.08,0:14:37.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,don't let the user do it
Dialogue: 0,0:14:37.36,0:14:39.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i mean the user may want to eventually
Dialogue: 0,0:14:39.20,0:14:41.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,do something but your job is the coder
Dialogue: 0,0:14:41.36,0:14:42.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to say all right what is the user going
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.72,0:14:43.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to need
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.44,0:14:47.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,give them the functionality to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:14:47.12,0:14:48.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and a follow-up question is should we be
Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.87,0:14:51.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,assuming that this r that gets
Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.20,0:14:54.87,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,passed in was created by this function
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.87,0:14:56.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and that is exactly the assumption that
Dialogue: 0,0:14:56.55,0:14:58.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you make for everything in here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:58.55,0:15:01.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,assume all r's uh
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.75,0:15:05.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,are the return value of calling rational
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.67,0:15:08.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah those are think of them as those
Dialogue: 0,0:15:08.55,0:15:09.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,are functions that
Dialogue: 0,0:15:09.44,0:15:12.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,operate on rational numbers defined
Dialogue: 0,0:15:12.48,0:15:14.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,using what you see above right that's
Dialogue: 0,0:15:14.79,0:15:16.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,what they operate on that's the data
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.55,0:15:19.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,type that they operate on
Dialogue: 0,0:15:19.36,0:15:22.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,exactly so we are making assumptions
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.96,0:15:24.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um wouldn't it be nice if we could like
Dialogue: 0,0:15:24.96,0:15:26.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,assert that somehow
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.63,0:15:30.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um well um you
Dialogue: 0,0:15:30.15,0:15:32.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you could try to set that up we haven't
Dialogue: 0,0:15:32.48,0:15:34.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,really talked about how to do it but
Dialogue: 0,0:15:34.08,0:15:35.91,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it's not terribly complicated
Dialogue: 0,0:15:35.91,0:15:39.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um you could just uh
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.03,0:15:42.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,add an is rational check
Dialogue: 0,0:15:42.24,0:15:44.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in here which does something and that is
Dialogue: 0,0:15:44.79,0:15:47.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,what you would assert
Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.91,0:15:49.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and you might want to set it up so that
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.44,0:15:51.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,not every pair every list
Dialogue: 0,0:15:51.67,0:15:53.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is this maybe you want to set it up so
Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.36,0:15:54.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that the way you really build these
Dialogue: 0,0:15:54.72,0:15:57.60,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is that you talk about it as a rational
Dialogue: 0,0:15:57.60,0:15:58.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,number
Dialogue: 0,0:15:58.72,0:16:01.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and then you could have this be like uh
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.12,0:16:02.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,return
Dialogue: 0,0:16:02.08,0:16:05.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,len r equals three and r zero
Dialogue: 0,0:16:05.20,0:16:07.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is this special string rational or
Dialogue: 0,0:16:07.27,0:16:09.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,something like that
Dialogue: 0,0:16:09.51,0:16:12.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so then basically not every list that
Dialogue: 0,0:16:12.72,0:16:14.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,has two numbers in it
Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.00,0:16:16.63,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is a rational number instead they all
Dialogue: 0,0:16:16.63,0:16:18.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,have this kind of special keyword this
Dialogue: 0,0:16:18.55,0:16:20.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is the kind of thing that was done
Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.48,0:16:23.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,quite broadly before um object-oriented
Dialogue: 0,0:16:23.03,0:16:24.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,programming
Dialogue: 0,0:16:24.00,0:16:26.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and it is the same idea that we'll see
Dialogue: 0,0:16:26.08,0:16:27.67,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in object-oriented programming except
Dialogue: 0,0:16:27.67,0:16:28.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,for that will then be
Dialogue: 0,0:16:28.79,0:16:30.08,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,kind of built into the language and
Dialogue: 0,0:16:30.08,0:16:31.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,happen for you automatically
Dialogue: 0,0:16:31.84,0:16:34.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so this is an old idea of tagging data
Dialogue: 0,0:16:34.39,0:16:35.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,types
Dialogue: 0,0:16:35.12,0:16:36.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and then kind of checking to make sure
Dialogue: 0,0:16:36.72,0:16:38.15,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that you have the right thing and i
Dialogue: 0,0:16:38.15,0:16:39.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,think it's a good one because it helps
Dialogue: 0,0:16:39.51,0:16:41.12,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,reinforce these assumptions right by the
Dialogue: 0,0:16:41.12,0:16:42.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,way notice something super cool in what
Dialogue: 0,0:16:42.79,0:16:44.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,john just did
Dialogue: 0,0:16:44.24,0:16:46.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,he just made a huge change in the
Dialogue: 0,0:16:46.24,0:16:47.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,underlying data representation of
Dialogue: 0,0:16:47.75,0:16:49.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:16:49.03,0:16:51.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it's now a triple with a string in the
Dialogue: 0,0:16:51.84,0:16:53.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,first position and the numerator in the
Dialogue: 0,0:16:53.36,0:16:54.32,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,denominator second
Dialogue: 0,0:16:54.32,0:16:56.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and third position what did he have to
Dialogue: 0,0:16:56.48,0:16:58.39,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,do to change the code to make
Dialogue: 0,0:16:58.39,0:17:00.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,everything work he had to change two
Dialogue: 0,0:17:00.00,0:17:01.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,functions right
Dialogue: 0,0:17:01.75,0:17:04.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,numer and denom and everything below
Dialogue: 0,0:17:04.88,0:17:06.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,stays exactly the same there is no
Dialogue: 0,0:17:06.96,0:17:09.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,impact on the rest of the code that
Dialogue: 0,0:17:09.35,0:17:11.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,right there what john just did
Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.11,0:17:14.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is sort of epitomizes the abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:17:14.00,0:17:16.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,barrier right he made a change up top
Dialogue: 0,0:17:16.07,0:17:17.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and there's absolutely no impact down
Dialogue: 0,0:17:17.83,0:17:20.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,below
Dialogue: 0,0:17:20.48,0:17:23.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the next question was how do you figure
Dialogue: 0,0:17:23.11,0:17:25.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,out in a tree recursion problem
Dialogue: 0,0:17:25.51,0:17:27.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,how to break down the problem into two
Dialogue: 0,0:17:27.75,0:17:29.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,recursive cases
Dialogue: 0,0:17:29.75,0:17:31.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so this is a question of how to think
Dialogue: 0,0:17:31.27,0:17:33.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about recursion and i think you're right
Dialogue: 0,0:17:33.27,0:17:35.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,there is something a little
Dialogue: 0,0:17:35.92,0:17:37.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,sort of twisted in the way you have to
Dialogue: 0,0:17:37.92,0:17:39.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,think about it so
Dialogue: 0,0:17:39.11,0:17:40.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,here's how i think about it and i don't
Dialogue: 0,0:17:40.64,0:17:41.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,know if this will be helpful either let
Dialogue: 0,0:17:41.75,0:17:43.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,me tell you how i think about it
Dialogue: 0,0:17:43.27,0:17:46.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,as i'm writing the function i tell
Dialogue: 0,0:17:46.00,0:17:46.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,myself
Dialogue: 0,0:17:46.64,0:17:49.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this function works and i can call this
Dialogue: 0,0:17:49.68,0:17:50.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,function
Dialogue: 0,0:17:50.48,0:17:52.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to do the thing i want it to do it's
Dialogue: 0,0:17:52.40,0:17:53.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,really sort of the ultimate in
Dialogue: 0,0:17:53.59,0:17:54.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:17:54.79,0:17:56.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i say i'm writing a function that
Dialogue: 0,0:17:56.55,0:17:58.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,computes fibonacci
Dialogue: 0,0:17:58.00,0:18:01.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,assume i have it and when i have it
Dialogue: 0,0:18:01.03,0:18:04.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,assume i can call it and then just do it
Dialogue: 0,0:18:04.40,0:18:07.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,just call the function and that's sort
Dialogue: 0,0:18:07.27,0:18:08.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of that's that leap of faith that we
Dialogue: 0,0:18:08.72,0:18:09.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,were talking about earlier you're going
Dialogue: 0,0:18:09.68,0:18:11.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to jump off the cliff and hope that the
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.20,0:18:12.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,parachute is
Dialogue: 0,0:18:12.07,0:18:14.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is going to get configured as your fault
Dialogue: 0,0:18:14.40,0:18:16.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,plummeting to the earth
Dialogue: 0,0:18:16.07,0:18:19.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah um so i think it is really thinking
Dialogue: 0,0:18:19.03,0:18:19.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about
Dialogue: 0,0:18:19.68,0:18:20.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the functionality first of all it's
Dialogue: 0,0:18:20.96,0:18:22.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,thinking about how the function is
Dialogue: 0,0:18:22.48,0:18:23.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,defined
Dialogue: 0,0:18:23.03,0:18:24.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,how the the problem is defined
Dialogue: 0,0:18:24.31,0:18:26.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,recursively and then just calling your
Dialogue: 0,0:18:26.48,0:18:27.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,function and
Dialogue: 0,0:18:27.27,0:18:28.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,one of the things that helps here is to
Dialogue: 0,0:18:28.79,0:18:30.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,use really sensible
Dialogue: 0,0:18:30.96,0:18:32.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,function names and variable names if
Dialogue: 0,0:18:32.40,0:18:34.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you're using them so that when you say
Dialogue: 0,0:18:34.24,0:18:35.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you know the fibonacci of n is the
Dialogue: 0,0:18:35.75,0:18:37.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,fibonacci of n minus one plus
Dialogue: 0,0:18:37.27,0:18:39.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,fibonacci of n minus two it sort of
Dialogue: 0,0:18:39.27,0:18:40.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,makes sense that you're just calling
Dialogue: 0,0:18:40.55,0:18:41.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this thing in some ways you can think
Dialogue: 0,0:18:41.75,0:18:42.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about
Dialogue: 0,0:18:42.00,0:18:43.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it is calling somebody else's function
Dialogue: 0,0:18:43.92,0:18:45.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that does the thing that you want the
Dialogue: 0,0:18:45.44,0:18:46.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,fact that a recursive is
Dialogue: 0,0:18:46.72,0:18:48.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,not really actually that important it
Dialogue: 0,0:18:48.00,0:18:49.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,turns out john may have
Dialogue: 0,0:18:49.75,0:18:52.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,another suggestion i thought that was
Dialogue: 0,0:18:52.07,0:18:53.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,great i i think the other
Dialogue: 0,0:18:53.68,0:18:55.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,one last piece to keep in mind is that
Dialogue: 0,0:18:55.92,0:18:57.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,many tree recursion
Dialogue: 0,0:18:57.83,0:19:01.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,problems involve making a choice
Dialogue: 0,0:19:01.44,0:19:04.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like am i gonna you know you're trying
Dialogue: 0,0:19:04.16,0:19:05.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to find the
Dialogue: 0,0:19:05.83,0:19:09.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,longest sequence within a list
Dialogue: 0,0:19:09.03,0:19:12.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that um that all increases or something
Dialogue: 0,0:19:12.48,0:19:13.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like that
Dialogue: 0,0:19:13.92,0:19:16.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the choice there might be am i going to
Dialogue: 0,0:19:16.96,0:19:18.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,keep the current element in the answer
Dialogue: 0,0:19:18.79,0:19:21.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,or am i going to throw it away
Dialogue: 0,0:19:21.44,0:19:25.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and figuring out what that choice is
Dialogue: 0,0:19:25.44,0:19:27.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,where if you stack many of these choices
Dialogue: 0,0:19:27.51,0:19:29.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,on top of each other make one after the
Dialogue: 0,0:19:29.20,0:19:29.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,other
Dialogue: 0,0:19:29.75,0:19:31.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,then you could get to any possible
Dialogue: 0,0:19:31.27,0:19:34.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,solution and this choice splits like
Dialogue: 0,0:19:34.24,0:19:36.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,all the possible solutions into two
Dialogue: 0,0:19:36.00,0:19:37.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,groups one that
Dialogue: 0,0:19:37.35,0:19:38.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,where this choice is true and one where
Dialogue: 0,0:19:38.88,0:19:41.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this choice is false
Dialogue: 0,0:19:41.20,0:19:43.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,finding that choice is often the key to
Dialogue: 0,0:19:43.68,0:19:45.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the implementation this was true for
Dialogue: 0,0:19:45.51,0:19:47.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,competitions it would be true for
Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.35,0:19:49.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,example in the account change problem on
Dialogue: 0,0:19:49.20,0:19:50.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,your homework
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.55,0:19:54.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um and it's not something that's
Dialogue: 0,0:19:54.07,0:19:55.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,obvious in the description of the
Dialogue: 0,0:19:55.92,0:19:57.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,problem instead it's part of the
Dialogue: 0,0:19:57.68,0:19:59.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,implementation that you have to figure
Dialogue: 0,0:19:59.20,0:20:00.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,out it's like how could i make one
Dialogue: 0,0:20:00.72,0:20:01.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,choice here
Dialogue: 0,0:20:01.75,0:20:03.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and by making similar choices many many
Dialogue: 0,0:20:03.83,0:20:05.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,times over i'll eventually get to the
Dialogue: 0,0:20:05.51,0:20:07.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,answer that i want and i don't think
Dialogue: 0,0:20:07.51,0:20:07.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it's
Dialogue: 0,0:20:07.92,0:20:10.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh trivial at all to come up with that
Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.48,0:20:11.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,choice
Dialogue: 0,0:20:11.27,0:20:12.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but you can think about options like oh
Dialogue: 0,0:20:12.96,0:20:14.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,am i going to use this first thing or
Dialogue: 0,0:20:14.72,0:20:15.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,not
Dialogue: 0,0:20:15.27,0:20:18.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is is often the choice and um
Dialogue: 0,0:20:18.79,0:20:20.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,or like how many of the first few things
Dialogue: 0,0:20:20.48,0:20:22.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,am i going to use one or two or three or
Dialogue: 0,0:20:22.00,0:20:23.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,four or whatever
Dialogue: 0,0:20:23.59,0:20:26.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and then coming up with the recursive
Dialogue: 0,0:20:26.88,0:20:27.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,calls
Dialogue: 0,0:20:27.35,0:20:29.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,usually is kind of mechanical once
Dialogue: 0,0:20:29.27,0:20:31.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you've figured out what the choice is
Dialogue: 0,0:20:31.03,0:20:34.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so in count partitions it was about
Dialogue: 0,0:20:34.79,0:20:37.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like am i going to use the biggest part
Dialogue: 0,0:20:37.51,0:20:38.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,or not
Dialogue: 0,0:20:38.64,0:20:41.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and um when i use it then i get one
Dialogue: 0,0:20:41.35,0:20:43.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,recursive call and when i forget about
Dialogue: 0,0:20:43.20,0:20:43.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it then i
Dialogue: 0,0:20:43.83,0:20:46.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,get another recursive call and and so
Dialogue: 0,0:20:46.48,0:20:48.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like you can often reconstruct what the
Dialogue: 0,0:20:48.07,0:20:49.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,recursive calls are
Dialogue: 0,0:20:49.75,0:20:52.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,just by thinking about like what happens
Dialogue: 0,0:20:52.31,0:20:53.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if i follow this choice
Dialogue: 0,0:20:53.92,0:20:56.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,path a or path b and then just like
Dialogue: 0,0:20:56.88,0:20:58.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,connie said in order to
Dialogue: 0,0:20:58.64,0:21:00.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,figure out whether you made progress or
Dialogue: 0,0:21:00.16,0:21:01.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,not you do have to assume that the
Dialogue: 0,0:21:01.51,0:21:02.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,function works
Dialogue: 0,0:21:02.64,0:21:04.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and think about that recursive call as
Dialogue: 0,0:21:04.64,0:21:06.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,something that's got behavior it's going
Dialogue: 0,0:21:06.16,0:21:07.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to do the right thing without worrying
Dialogue: 0,0:21:07.59,0:21:09.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about how it does it
Dialogue: 0,0:21:09.59,0:21:11.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah and then the less good answer here
Dialogue: 0,0:21:11.83,0:21:13.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to this is it will come with experience
Dialogue: 0,0:21:13.68,0:21:14.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like you just you got to do more
Dialogue: 0,0:21:14.72,0:21:16.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,examples you'll start to see patterns
Dialogue: 0,0:21:16.72,0:21:17.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,emerge
Dialogue: 0,0:21:17.59,0:21:19.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,there's a relatively small number of
Dialogue: 0,0:21:19.59,0:21:20.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,patterns emerge that
Dialogue: 0,0:21:20.79,0:21:22.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in doing recursive functions and the
Dialogue: 0,0:21:22.72,0:21:24.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,more you do the more comfortable you'll
Dialogue: 0,0:21:24.00,0:21:26.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,get with it
Dialogue: 0,0:21:26.55,0:21:29.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um almost so the question is about this
Dialogue: 0,0:21:29.20,0:21:31.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,concept of getters and setters
Dialogue: 0,0:21:31.27,0:21:33.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in java and is that the same thing as
Dialogue: 0,0:21:33.83,0:21:35.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,constructors and selectors
Dialogue: 0,0:21:35.92,0:21:38.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in data abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:21:38.96,0:21:40.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and there isn't quite a one-to-one
Dialogue: 0,0:21:40.79,0:21:42.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,mapping there instead what i would say
Dialogue: 0,0:21:42.48,0:21:44.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is that constructors are like
Dialogue: 0,0:21:44.24,0:21:47.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,instructors in java and that
Dialogue: 0,0:21:47.59,0:21:49.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selectors are like getters and we
Dialogue: 0,0:21:49.59,0:21:51.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,haven't really talked about setters at
Dialogue: 0,0:21:51.27,0:21:53.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,all because we haven't talked about
Dialogue: 0,0:21:53.27,0:21:55.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,changing a value at all yet but we will
Dialogue: 0,0:21:55.44,0:21:56.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,get there so if you really wanted to
Dialogue: 0,0:21:56.96,0:21:59.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,replicate that behavior from java then
Dialogue: 0,0:21:59.03,0:22:00.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you'd need another set
Dialogue: 0,0:22:00.64,0:22:03.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of setter functions in addition to the
Dialogue: 0,0:22:03.03,0:22:04.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selector functions
Dialogue: 0,0:22:04.16,0:22:07.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and the constructor but conceptually yes
Dialogue: 0,0:22:07.59,0:22:09.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it is it's it's those the setters and
Dialogue: 0,0:22:09.44,0:22:11.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the getters probably
Dialogue: 0,0:22:11.03,0:22:13.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like my the the hairs on the back of my
Dialogue: 0,0:22:13.51,0:22:14.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,neck
Dialogue: 0,0:22:14.07,0:22:15.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,cringe when i hear that because i'm not
Dialogue: 0,0:22:15.44,0:22:16.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a big fan of the java programming
Dialogue: 0,0:22:16.88,0:22:17.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,language
Dialogue: 0,0:22:17.51,0:22:19.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but conceptually that what they are
Dialogue: 0,0:22:19.27,0:22:20.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about is data abstraction they are
Dialogue: 0,0:22:20.79,0:22:22.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,hiding details
Dialogue: 0,0:22:22.24,0:22:23.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,from the rest of the code and so
Dialogue: 0,0:22:23.75,0:22:25.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,conceptually that is the same idea and
Dialogue: 0,0:22:25.51,0:22:27.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you'll see that get formalized a little
Dialogue: 0,0:22:27.03,0:22:27.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,bit more
Dialogue: 0,0:22:27.83,0:22:29.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in python too there is a not there is a
Dialogue: 0,0:22:29.75,0:22:31.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,notion of classes and objects in python
Dialogue: 0,0:22:31.68,0:22:33.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and we'll see that
Dialogue: 0,0:22:33.83,0:22:35.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,well great question so the question is
Dialogue: 0,0:22:35.44,0:22:37.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like what exactly is a constructor and a
Dialogue: 0,0:22:37.83,0:22:40.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selector we've done one example and how
Dialogue: 0,0:22:40.24,0:22:42.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,does this generalize to other examples
Dialogue: 0,0:22:42.55,0:22:44.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and like what counts as constructors and
Dialogue: 0,0:22:44.55,0:22:46.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selectors and what doesn't
Dialogue: 0,0:22:46.48,0:22:48.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the the core concept here is about data
Dialogue: 0,0:22:48.64,0:22:49.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,representation
Dialogue: 0,0:22:49.83,0:22:52.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,there's like something in the world and
Dialogue: 0,0:22:52.00,0:22:54.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you want to write a program about it
Dialogue: 0,0:22:54.16,0:22:55.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but your program is just full of like
Dialogue: 0,0:22:55.92,0:22:57.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,numbers and lists and strings
Dialogue: 0,0:22:57.83,0:22:59.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,how do you represent something else in
Dialogue: 0,0:22:59.44,0:23:01.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the world that's um
Dialogue: 0,0:23:01.11,0:23:04.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,more complicated and rational numbers in
Dialogue: 0,0:23:04.24,0:23:06.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,some sense is a bad example because it's
Dialogue: 0,0:23:06.16,0:23:08.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,just more numbers but what we really
Dialogue: 0,0:23:08.07,0:23:09.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,should be thinking about is
Dialogue: 0,0:23:09.68,0:23:12.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like how do you represent a whole um
Dialogue: 0,0:23:12.79,0:23:15.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,house and because you're building like a
Dialogue: 0,0:23:15.03,0:23:16.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,real estate site
Dialogue: 0,0:23:16.64,0:23:19.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,well a house like has all kinds of
Dialogue: 0,0:23:19.11,0:23:21.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,attributes it's got a
Dialogue: 0,0:23:21.03,0:23:23.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,location oh so how we're going to
Dialogue: 0,0:23:23.44,0:23:25.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,represent locations
Dialogue: 0,0:23:25.03,0:23:28.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh it's got a layout oh so how are we
Dialogue: 0,0:23:28.55,0:23:30.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,going to represent the layout
Dialogue: 0,0:23:30.16,0:23:32.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,well all of these are actually like
Dialogue: 0,0:23:32.96,0:23:34.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,different data abstractions that you
Dialogue: 0,0:23:34.72,0:23:36.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,could include you could have
Dialogue: 0,0:23:36.00,0:23:38.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a location is represented as its
Dialogue: 0,0:23:38.31,0:23:40.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,longitude and latitude but that might
Dialogue: 0,0:23:40.07,0:23:41.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,not actually be right
Dialogue: 0,0:23:41.51,0:23:43.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,instead it should be represented as like
Dialogue: 0,0:23:43.51,0:23:44.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it's a
Dialogue: 0,0:23:44.55,0:23:47.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,street address which has a number and a
Dialogue: 0,0:23:47.92,0:23:50.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,street name and the zip code and stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:23:50.96,0:23:51.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like that
Dialogue: 0,0:23:51.75,0:23:53.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so basically everything interesting in
Dialogue: 0,0:23:53.27,0:23:55.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the world has multiple different
Dialogue: 0,0:23:55.44,0:23:57.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,attributes multiple different parts
Dialogue: 0,0:23:57.20,0:23:59.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and some of those have parts and some of
Dialogue: 0,0:23:59.11,0:24:00.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,those have parts
Dialogue: 0,0:24:00.24,0:24:02.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and data abstraction gives you a tool
Dialogue: 0,0:24:02.72,0:24:04.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,for managing all of this
Dialogue: 0,0:24:04.00,0:24:05.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,where you can say like oh a house is
Dialogue: 0,0:24:05.51,0:24:07.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,built out of its location and its layout
Dialogue: 0,0:24:07.68,0:24:10.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and a location is built out of its uh
Dialogue: 0,0:24:10.16,0:24:11.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,street address and its longitude and
Dialogue: 0,0:24:11.83,0:24:13.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,latitude and the street address is built
Dialogue: 0,0:24:13.75,0:24:15.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,out of a bubble ball
Dialogue: 0,0:24:15.27,0:24:18.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so the whole use of constructors and
Dialogue: 0,0:24:18.40,0:24:19.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selectors
Dialogue: 0,0:24:19.03,0:24:21.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in a larger program would be to define
Dialogue: 0,0:24:21.68,0:24:22.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,these things that you're trying to
Dialogue: 0,0:24:22.96,0:24:23.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,describe
Dialogue: 0,0:24:23.59,0:24:25.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in your larger program so they would say
Dialogue: 0,0:24:25.44,0:24:27.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like oh i'm going to give function names
Dialogue: 0,0:24:27.27,0:24:28.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that associate
Dialogue: 0,0:24:28.40,0:24:30.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to each one of these attributes of some
Dialogue: 0,0:24:30.55,0:24:32.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,concept that i'm trying to represent
Dialogue: 0,0:24:32.16,0:24:34.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like a house and i'm going to say like
Dialogue: 0,0:24:34.55,0:24:36.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,every time i build a house i need these
Dialogue: 0,0:24:36.31,0:24:37.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,three things
Dialogue: 0,0:24:37.27,0:24:40.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and every time i have a house already
Dialogue: 0,0:24:40.07,0:24:42.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and i have a name for that i can access
Dialogue: 0,0:24:42.07,0:24:44.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,those attributes
Dialogue: 0,0:24:44.07,0:24:45.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,here's another example let's say you
Dialogue: 0,0:24:45.51,0:24:47.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,want to build b courses
Dialogue: 0,0:24:47.44,0:24:48.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah so what do you need you need a
Dialogue: 0,0:24:48.96,0:24:50.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,course what's a course
Dialogue: 0,0:24:50.55,0:24:52.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,well it has a title it has an instructor
Dialogue: 0,0:24:52.64,0:24:54.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it has a date and time
Dialogue: 0,0:24:54.40,0:24:56.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it has a well it used to have locations
Dialogue: 0,0:24:56.64,0:24:58.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,where they were being taught
Dialogue: 0,0:24:58.40,0:25:00.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you have students students have ids they
Dialogue: 0,0:25:00.72,0:25:02.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,have scores they have the year
Dialogue: 0,0:25:02.40,0:25:05.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of their enrollment and then you want to
Dialogue: 0,0:25:05.35,0:25:07.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,be able to construct a student
Dialogue: 0,0:25:07.35,0:25:09.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that's a constructor you want to be able
Dialogue: 0,0:25:09.20,0:25:10.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to ask something about
Dialogue: 0,0:25:10.64,0:25:13.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a student what's their student id number
Dialogue: 0,0:25:13.35,0:25:14.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um
Dialogue: 0,0:25:14.40,0:25:16.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,what is their grade on this exam or on
Dialogue: 0,0:25:16.88,0:25:18.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this homework
Dialogue: 0,0:25:18.24,0:25:20.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and so john said it exactly right that
Dialogue: 0,0:25:20.55,0:25:22.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the rationals is a really simple example
Dialogue: 0,0:25:22.48,0:25:23.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,right you just have these two little
Dialogue: 0,0:25:23.68,0:25:25.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,numbers in the list and you're like
Dialogue: 0,0:25:25.11,0:25:26.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,why am i doing all this fussiness for
Dialogue: 0,0:25:26.88,0:25:29.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that but as you build bigger programs
Dialogue: 0,0:25:29.44,0:25:31.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the amount of data you have can get very
Dialogue: 0,0:25:31.27,0:25:33.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,complex and again you want to hide that
Dialogue: 0,0:25:33.27,0:25:35.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,implementation detail from the user
Dialogue: 0,0:25:35.83,0:25:37.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and we'll see examples of that you'll
Dialogue: 0,0:25:37.51,0:25:39.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,see where we start to build more complex
Dialogue: 0,0:25:39.75,0:25:40.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,data
Dialogue: 0,0:25:40.96,0:25:42.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,types and where you need to be able to
Dialogue: 0,0:25:42.88,0:25:45.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,use these things
Dialogue: 0,0:25:45.59,0:25:47.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a follow-up question was is there a
Dialogue: 0,0:25:47.51,0:25:49.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,difference between constructors and
Dialogue: 0,0:25:49.35,0:25:51.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selectors or are they basically the same
Dialogue: 0,0:25:51.35,0:25:52.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,thing
Dialogue: 0,0:25:52.16,0:25:53.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,there there is a difference between
Dialogue: 0,0:25:53.68,0:25:55.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,constructors and selectors so let's go
Dialogue: 0,0:25:55.35,0:25:56.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,let's do the rational example
Dialogue: 0,0:25:56.96,0:25:59.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the constructor creates a rational
Dialogue: 0,0:25:59.35,0:26:00.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,number
Dialogue: 0,0:26:00.31,0:26:03.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah it takes two numbers takes takes a
Dialogue: 0,0:26:03.35,0:26:04.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,list and hands that back to you
Dialogue: 0,0:26:04.72,0:26:07.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the selector says give me one part of
Dialogue: 0,0:26:07.92,0:26:09.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the data the numerator
Dialogue: 0,0:26:09.44,0:26:11.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,or the denominator in my example of b
Dialogue: 0,0:26:11.59,0:26:13.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,courses a constructor
Dialogue: 0,0:26:13.03,0:26:15.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,would create a record for a student it
Dialogue: 0,0:26:15.68,0:26:17.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,would populate everything
Dialogue: 0,0:26:17.11,0:26:18.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that was passed to it and then the
Dialogue: 0,0:26:18.79,0:26:20.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,selector would say okay give me these
Dialogue: 0,0:26:20.07,0:26:21.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,little pieces of information
Dialogue: 0,0:26:21.59,0:26:24.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,associated with a student that has been
Dialogue: 0,0:26:24.07,0:26:24.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,constructed
Dialogue: 0,0:26:24.88,0:26:28.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah the next question was is data
Dialogue: 0,0:26:28.31,0:26:29.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:26:29.35,0:26:31.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,similar to object oriented programming
Dialogue: 0,0:26:31.92,0:26:34.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,are they basically the same thing
Dialogue: 0,0:26:34.40,0:26:36.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,they are they are absolutely i mean
Dialogue: 0,0:26:36.48,0:26:38.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,they're object-oriented programming is
Dialogue: 0,0:26:38.55,0:26:39.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,designed
Dialogue: 0,0:26:39.27,0:26:42.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,around this notion of data abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:26:42.16,0:26:43.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that you build these
Dialogue: 0,0:26:43.51,0:26:46.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,classes slash objects you abstract out
Dialogue: 0,0:26:46.55,0:26:48.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the underlying data with constructors
Dialogue: 0,0:26:48.40,0:26:50.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and selectors you create functionality
Dialogue: 0,0:26:50.48,0:26:51.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,within the class
Dialogue: 0,0:26:51.75,0:26:53.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and then you combine those classes to
Dialogue: 0,0:26:53.51,0:26:55.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,create larger programs
Dialogue: 0,0:26:55.20,0:26:57.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and object when did object-oriented
Dialogue: 0,0:26:57.03,0:26:58.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,start john maybe
Dialogue: 0,0:26:58.64,0:27:00.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,20 years ago something like that
Dialogue: 0,0:27:00.96,0:27:03.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,certainly became popular like 20-30
Dialogue: 0,0:27:03.11,0:27:05.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,years ago i think yeah
Dialogue: 0,0:27:05.35,0:27:08.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it's back to small talk so it's uh its
Dialogue: 0,0:27:08.64,0:27:10.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,invention was older than that but um
Dialogue: 0,0:27:10.79,0:27:12.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but it's certainly become like the
Dialogue: 0,0:27:12.48,0:27:14.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,dominant paradigm for building
Dialogue: 0,0:27:14.24,0:27:15.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,applications more recently
Dialogue: 0,0:27:15.75,0:27:17.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,right but but you're absolutely right
Dialogue: 0,0:27:17.68,0:27:19.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,audrey that this is
Dialogue: 0,0:27:19.20,0:27:21.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this is this is the this is the lead up
Dialogue: 0,0:27:21.75,0:27:22.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to
Dialogue: 0,0:27:22.31,0:27:24.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,classes objects and object-oriented
Dialogue: 0,0:27:24.07,0:27:25.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,programming
Dialogue: 0,0:27:25.59,0:27:27.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah and i think object-oriented
Dialogue: 0,0:27:27.11,0:27:28.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,programming has multiple ideas
Dialogue: 0,0:27:28.88,0:27:30.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,all kind of lumped into one in this
Dialogue: 0,0:27:30.55,0:27:32.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,course we try to isolate them a little
Dialogue: 0,0:27:32.48,0:27:34.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,bit to give you some exposure before we
Dialogue: 0,0:27:34.72,0:27:36.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,kind of throw you into everything at
Dialogue: 0,0:27:36.07,0:27:38.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,once so this is the biggest one
Dialogue: 0,0:27:38.48,0:27:41.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,thing that objects allow you
Dialogue: 0,0:27:41.51,0:27:43.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to do data abstraction but it's built
Dialogue: 0,0:27:43.44,0:27:45.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,into the language instead of you having
Dialogue: 0,0:27:45.27,0:27:47.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to decide the representation every time
Dialogue: 0,0:27:47.03,0:27:50.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that kind of happens automatically
Dialogue: 0,0:27:50.96,0:27:54.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the second is about
Dialogue: 0,0:27:54.55,0:27:56.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,changing state which we'll talk about
Dialogue: 0,0:27:56.40,0:27:58.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,next in the course like very soon
Dialogue: 0,0:27:58.48,0:28:00.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and the third is about like
Dialogue: 0,0:28:00.55,0:28:02.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,relationships between types which is
Dialogue: 0,0:28:02.31,0:28:03.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,something that
Dialogue: 0,0:28:03.03,0:28:05.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,actually is used less i'd say in modern
Dialogue: 0,0:28:05.92,0:28:06.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,programming
Dialogue: 0,0:28:06.64,0:28:08.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,than these other two features but it's
Dialogue: 0,0:28:08.88,0:28:10.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,also an important characteristic of
Dialogue: 0,0:28:10.24,0:28:11.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,object-oriented programming
Dialogue: 0,0:28:11.75,0:28:13.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,which we'll teach as we teach you about
Dialogue: 0,0:28:13.92,0:28:15.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,object-oriented programming and so
Dialogue: 0,0:28:15.35,0:28:16.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that's coming up as kind of the next
Dialogue: 0,0:28:16.96,0:28:17.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,unit
Dialogue: 0,0:28:17.75,0:28:20.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in the course uh after we finish talking
Dialogue: 0,0:28:20.07,0:28:21.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about data abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:28:21.35,0:28:23.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and uh what we call mutation which is
Dialogue: 0,0:28:23.75,0:28:26.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,basically like objects that are changing
Dialogue: 0,0:28:26.16,0:28:27.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,then we'll put that together and you can
Dialogue: 0,0:28:27.83,0:28:29.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,see how it's built into the language
Dialogue: 0,0:28:29.27,0:28:30.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,using objects
Dialogue: 0,0:28:30.64,0:28:32.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and by the way since somebody mentioned
Dialogue: 0,0:28:32.31,0:28:34.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,java earlier let me just mention a few
Dialogue: 0,0:28:34.16,0:28:34.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,things
Dialogue: 0,0:28:34.64,0:28:36.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if you've done any java programming if
Dialogue: 0,0:28:36.48,0:28:37.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you haven't just ignored what i'm about
Dialogue: 0,0:28:37.68,0:28:39.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,to say but if you've done notice that in
Dialogue: 0,0:28:39.03,0:28:39.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,java
Dialogue: 0,0:28:39.83,0:28:41.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,everything's an object you can't really
Dialogue: 0,0:28:41.51,0:28:43.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,can't do anything without objects and
Dialogue: 0,0:28:43.03,0:28:44.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,one of the great things about python is
Dialogue: 0,0:28:44.72,0:28:46.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,there is you will see that there is an
Dialogue: 0,0:28:46.55,0:28:48.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,infrastructure for doing object
Dialogue: 0,0:28:48.00,0:28:49.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,programming but you don't have to use it
Dialogue: 0,0:28:49.51,0:28:51.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it gives you that sort of flexibility
Dialogue: 0,0:28:51.68,0:28:53.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um and that's actually by the way
Dialogue: 0,0:28:53.11,0:28:54.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,pedagogically one of the reasons why i
Dialogue: 0,0:28:54.72,0:28:56.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,like python as
Dialogue: 0,0:28:56.24,0:28:58.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a first language is it it doesn't get
Dialogue: 0,0:28:58.07,0:29:01.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,into all of this stuff on day one you
Dialogue: 0,0:29:01.03,0:29:02.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,can actually
Dialogue: 0,0:29:02.00,0:29:04.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,well extract it out and not worry about
Dialogue: 0,0:29:04.24,0:29:07.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it until you have to worry about it
Dialogue: 0,0:29:07.51,0:29:09.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the next question was for the slide that
Dialogue: 0,0:29:09.75,0:29:11.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,lit on fire
Dialogue: 0,0:29:11.03,0:29:13.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,what exactly was wrong with the code
Dialogue: 0,0:29:13.03,0:29:14.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that was written there how did it
Dialogue: 0,0:29:14.48,0:29:17.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,violate data abstraction principles
Dialogue: 0,0:29:17.83,0:29:20.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,oh yeah first of all can we just applaud
Dialogue: 0,0:29:20.64,0:29:22.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,john for how awesome that slide was
Dialogue: 0,0:29:22.72,0:29:26.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um i really i was i was i
Dialogue: 0,0:29:26.00,0:29:27.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i got a great kick out of that and by
Dialogue: 0,0:29:27.92,0:29:30.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the way it violated the data abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:29:30.07,0:29:31.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in so many different ways i don't even
Dialogue: 0,0:29:31.27,0:29:34.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,think john enumerated all of them
Dialogue: 0,0:29:34.96,0:29:37.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yeah i mean it's hard it's hard to think
Dialogue: 0,0:29:37.20,0:29:39.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about a large program in the context of
Dialogue: 0,0:29:39.51,0:29:41.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,a lecture where the program is actually
Dialogue: 0,0:29:41.20,0:29:41.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,tiny
Dialogue: 0,0:29:41.83,0:29:45.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,right so um so what's wrong with this
Dialogue: 0,0:29:45.03,0:29:45.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,code
Dialogue: 0,0:29:45.51,0:29:48.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it looks sort of fine right but it is
Dialogue: 0,0:29:48.00,0:29:49.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,violating these general programming
Dialogue: 0,0:29:49.51,0:29:50.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,principles
Dialogue: 0,0:29:50.40,0:29:52.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,which are really important if we were
Dialogue: 0,0:29:52.24,0:29:53.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,writing a larger program
Dialogue: 0,0:29:53.59,0:29:57.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and so what we would expect here
Dialogue: 0,0:29:57.35,0:30:00.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is that ad rational would only take as
Dialogue: 0,0:30:00.55,0:30:02.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,arguments
Dialogue: 0,0:30:02.72,0:30:04.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the return value of calls to the
Dialogue: 0,0:30:04.96,0:30:07.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational constructor
Dialogue: 0,0:30:07.35,0:30:10.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so when earlier in this discussion
Dialogue: 0,0:30:10.48,0:30:12.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,oh i guess i deleted it yeah you changed
Dialogue: 0,0:30:12.96,0:30:15.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the representation of rationals to like
Dialogue: 0,0:30:15.20,0:30:17.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,include a third element a string
Dialogue: 0,0:30:17.59,0:30:19.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this line of code would break as a
Dialogue: 0,0:30:19.51,0:30:21.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,result because it doesn't call rational
Dialogue: 0,0:30:21.83,0:30:23.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,on one and two
Dialogue: 0,0:30:23.20,0:30:25.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,instead it just builds a list of one and
Dialogue: 0,0:30:25.20,0:30:27.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,two which means that if you ever changed
Dialogue: 0,0:30:27.03,0:30:28.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the behavior of rational
Dialogue: 0,0:30:28.55,0:30:30.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you'd have to go change this line of
Dialogue: 0,0:30:30.31,0:30:32.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,code which we don't want to do
Dialogue: 0,0:30:32.16,0:30:34.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so the idea is that every call to add
Dialogue: 0,0:30:34.64,0:30:35.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational
Dialogue: 0,0:30:35.59,0:30:38.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,should not be affected by changing the
Dialogue: 0,0:30:38.88,0:30:40.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,implementation of rational
Dialogue: 0,0:30:40.64,0:30:43.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,or its selectors numero and dino so that
Dialogue: 0,0:30:43.68,0:30:45.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,was what was wrong with this line
Dialogue: 0,0:30:45.59,0:30:47.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is that we passed in the wrong kinds of
Dialogue: 0,0:30:47.59,0:30:49.35,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,arguments to add rational
Dialogue: 0,0:30:49.35,0:30:51.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,even though it ran it wouldn't run in
Dialogue: 0,0:30:51.68,0:30:52.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the future
Dialogue: 0,0:30:52.72,0:30:56.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,if we had changed the implementation of
Dialogue: 0,0:30:56.24,0:30:59.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,the constructor and the selectors
Dialogue: 0,0:30:59.03,0:31:02.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,what a mess right is that like the code
Dialogue: 0,0:31:02.07,0:31:02.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is wrong because
Dialogue: 0,0:31:02.96,0:31:04.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,one day it might be wrong but right now
Dialogue: 0,0:31:04.64,0:31:06.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it's right well that's exactly the kind
Dialogue: 0,0:31:06.64,0:31:07.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of thing you
Dialogue: 0,0:31:07.11,0:31:08.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,do have to think about if you're
Dialogue: 0,0:31:08.79,0:31:10.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,building large programs
Dialogue: 0,0:31:10.16,0:31:12.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,is that it's not good enough that this
Dialogue: 0,0:31:12.07,0:31:13.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,thing runs today
Dialogue: 0,0:31:13.68,0:31:16.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and uh doesn't crash and passes all the
Dialogue: 0,0:31:16.79,0:31:18.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,dock tests or whatever
Dialogue: 0,0:31:18.16,0:31:20.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it really has to be built with an eye
Dialogue: 0,0:31:20.72,0:31:22.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,toward the future
Dialogue: 0,0:31:22.00,0:31:24.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,where decisions that you made about your
Dialogue: 0,0:31:24.24,0:31:25.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,implementation
Dialogue: 0,0:31:25.20,0:31:27.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,when you're first getting started are
Dialogue: 0,0:31:27.20,0:31:28.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,certainly going to change because you're
Dialogue: 0,0:31:28.64,0:31:29.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,going to think of something new
Dialogue: 0,0:31:29.75,0:31:32.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,later like you want to be able to assert
Dialogue: 0,0:31:32.40,0:31:33.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that something's rational so you need to
Dialogue: 0,0:31:33.92,0:31:35.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,change the representation
Dialogue: 0,0:31:35.68,0:31:38.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,well look like uh if you have to go back
Dialogue: 0,0:31:38.31,0:31:40.16,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and edit all your code then you're never
Dialogue: 0,0:31:40.16,0:31:41.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,going to want to make changes
Dialogue: 0,0:31:41.44,0:31:43.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and that means your code base will never
Dialogue: 0,0:31:43.44,0:31:46.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,improve and you'll end up with kind of a
Dialogue: 0,0:31:46.48,0:31:48.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,program that's stuck with all the
Dialogue: 0,0:31:48.24,0:31:50.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,problems that you ever inserted
Dialogue: 0,0:31:50.24,0:31:52.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,whereas if you write code that's sort of
Dialogue: 0,0:31:52.64,0:31:53.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,future proof
Dialogue: 0,0:31:53.44,0:31:55.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,in this way by using these abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:31:55.59,0:31:57.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,barriers to isolate
Dialogue: 0,0:31:57.20,0:32:00.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,parts of the program then uh
Dialogue: 0,0:32:00.88,0:32:02.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,then you can be comfortable making
Dialogue: 0,0:32:02.96,0:32:04.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,changes and
Dialogue: 0,0:32:04.24,0:32:06.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,uh you won't have to worry about
Dialogue: 0,0:32:06.00,0:32:08.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,breaking anything that was already there
Dialogue: 0,0:32:08.72,0:32:10.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so that was basically the story and and
Dialogue: 0,0:32:10.48,0:32:12.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,what you see here is true down here as
Dialogue: 0,0:32:12.79,0:32:13.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,well
Dialogue: 0,0:32:13.27,0:32:15.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,divide rational was supposed to be part
Dialogue: 0,0:32:15.27,0:32:16.72,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of the program
Dialogue: 0,0:32:16.72,0:32:18.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that assumes it's getting rational
Dialogue: 0,0:32:18.79,0:32:20.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,numbers and
Dialogue: 0,0:32:20.40,0:32:23.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,only manipulates them using the
Dialogue: 0,0:32:23.51,0:32:24.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,constructor and the selector
Dialogue: 0,0:32:24.88,0:32:27.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so it should have returned a call to
Dialogue: 0,0:32:27.27,0:32:28.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,rational
Dialogue: 0,0:32:28.55,0:32:30.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that got the numerator and the
Dialogue: 0,0:32:30.83,0:32:32.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,denominators
Dialogue: 0,0:32:32.00,0:32:34.40,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,using calls to numer and dnom and that's
Dialogue: 0,0:32:34.40,0:32:35.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,not what we did
Dialogue: 0,0:32:35.59,0:32:37.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and therefore this would have to be
Dialogue: 0,0:32:37.03,0:32:38.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,entirely rewritten if
Dialogue: 0,0:32:38.96,0:32:41.20,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,we changed the implementation of the
Dialogue: 0,0:32:41.20,0:32:43.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,data abstraction
Dialogue: 0,0:32:44.07,0:32:45.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this is this is a really important
Dialogue: 0,0:32:45.75,0:32:47.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,concept and it's
Dialogue: 0,0:32:47.11,0:32:49.83,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it's understandable if it's not entirely
Dialogue: 0,0:32:49.83,0:32:51.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,crystal clear in your head
Dialogue: 0,0:32:51.44,0:32:54.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,don't worry as we do bigger examples and
Dialogue: 0,0:32:54.55,0:32:56.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,more examples you'll start to see that
Dialogue: 0,0:32:56.07,0:32:57.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,abstraction but it is something that
Dialogue: 0,0:32:57.92,0:33:01.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um johnson did exactly right um is
Dialogue: 0,0:33:01.44,0:33:03.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,at least for me when i really learned
Dialogue: 0,0:33:03.11,0:33:05.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this is when i had to either change my
Dialogue: 0,0:33:05.11,0:33:07.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,code or change somebody else's code
Dialogue: 0,0:33:07.27,0:33:09.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and i realized that you know something i
Dialogue: 0,0:33:09.75,0:33:11.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,would do up here in some function had
Dialogue: 0,0:33:11.27,0:33:13.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this weird effect down below
Dialogue: 0,0:33:13.44,0:33:14.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and you're just going to learn by
Dialogue: 0,0:33:14.96,0:33:16.64,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,writing crappy code
Dialogue: 0,0:33:16.64,0:33:18.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and you're going to realize oh this when
Dialogue: 0,0:33:18.55,0:33:20.07,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i want to make some change to something
Dialogue: 0,0:33:20.07,0:33:20.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,which
Dialogue: 0,0:33:20.55,0:33:23.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,always happens um and it's and sometimes
Dialogue: 0,0:33:23.11,0:33:23.59,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,it's
Dialogue: 0,0:33:23.59,0:33:25.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you start writing code and then you
Dialogue: 0,0:33:25.44,0:33:27.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,realize you you forgot something
Dialogue: 0,0:33:27.03,0:33:29.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you've already got 10 000 lines of code
Dialogue: 0,0:33:29.11,0:33:30.48,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you got to make some big change back
Dialogue: 0,0:33:30.48,0:33:31.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,early on
Dialogue: 0,0:33:31.27,0:33:32.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and you're like oh crap this is going to
Dialogue: 0,0:33:32.96,0:33:34.79,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,trickle all the way down
Dialogue: 0,0:33:34.79,0:33:36.31,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and so that's when you start really sort
Dialogue: 0,0:33:36.31,0:33:38.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of thinking you know really hard
Dialogue: 0,0:33:38.00,0:33:39.75,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,about these abstractions and how you
Dialogue: 0,0:33:39.75,0:33:41.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,write code in a way that can
Dialogue: 0,0:33:41.92,0:33:43.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,build sort of a really solid
Dialogue: 0,0:33:43.92,0:33:44.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,infrastructure
Dialogue: 0,0:33:44.96,0:33:46.24,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so it takes a little bit of time and
Dialogue: 0,0:33:46.24,0:33:49.11,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,experience so hang tight
Dialogue: 0,0:33:49.11,0:33:50.88,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,this is maybe the first topic in the
Dialogue: 0,0:33:50.88,0:33:53.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,course where having learned it
Dialogue: 0,0:33:53.27,0:33:57.27,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you can't do anything no
Dialogue: 0,0:33:57.27,0:33:59.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,at this point some chaos ensued because
Dialogue: 0,0:33:59.68,0:34:01.68,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of the phone call i received
Dialogue: 0,0:34:01.68,0:34:04.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,and i've edited that part out
Dialogue: 0,0:34:04.96,0:34:07.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,um well who knows what i was saying but
Dialogue: 0,0:34:07.03,0:34:10.32,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,i'm sure it was very you're saying
Dialogue: 0,0:34:10.63,0:34:11.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you're saying that this is one of the
Dialogue: 0,0:34:11.92,0:34:13.36,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,concepts where you learn it it's not
Dialogue: 0,0:34:13.36,0:34:15.03,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,immediately obvious how to apply it just
Dialogue: 0,0:34:15.03,0:34:15.51,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,yet
Dialogue: 0,0:34:15.51,0:34:16.96,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,right you can't like write some program
Dialogue: 0,0:34:16.96,0:34:18.71,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,that you couldn't write before
Dialogue: 0,0:34:18.71,0:34:21.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,but you know also a topic that students
Dialogue: 0,0:34:21.84,0:34:23.28,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,tell me is one of the more important
Dialogue: 0,0:34:23.28,0:34:24.32,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,things that they learned
Dialogue: 0,0:34:24.32,0:34:26.23,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,while they were in 61a because it
Dialogue: 0,0:34:26.23,0:34:27.44,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,applies so much to
Dialogue: 0,0:34:27.44,0:34:29.92,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,kind of later parts yeah this is the one
Dialogue: 0,0:34:29.92,0:34:31.28,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,concept that will carry you
Dialogue: 0,0:34:31.28,0:34:34.32,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,just about every class you take when
Dialogue: 0,0:34:34.32,0:34:36.23,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you're writing code this is probably one
Dialogue: 0,0:34:36.23,0:34:37.84,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,of the most important concepts that
Dialogue: 0,0:34:37.84,0:34:39.19,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,you'll take away from you and it's also
Dialogue: 0,0:34:39.19,0:34:40.55,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,one of the most abstract
Dialogue: 0,0:34:40.55,0:34:42.00,BottomCenter,,0,0,0,,so that's okay that just means it takes
