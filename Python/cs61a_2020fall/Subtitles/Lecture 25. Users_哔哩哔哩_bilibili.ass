Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.00,0:08:56.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,you see it has a

Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.30,0:09:00.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and has some plenty of little things that look
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.20,0:09:01.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,like that tapes were actually
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.50,0:09:02.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,originally designed for this
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.27,0:09:04.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,machine and one of the
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.40,0:09:07.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,design criteria for this machine was it was supposed to be
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.40,0:09:09.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,small enough on the desk
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.93,0:09:11.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so that a person could see over it
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.97,0:09:14.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so one of the ideas that this machine should not be intimidating
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.50,0:09:18.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and about two thousand of these were built in the sixties
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.17,0:09:22.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,mostly for biomedical technicians who didn't
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.73,0:09:23.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,have a mainframe
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.97,0:09:26.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,to enter disposal
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.40,0:09:28.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and didn't want to hire programmers to use it
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.57,0:09:30.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,they wanted something if they can build
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.73,0:09:33.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,setup experiments themselves through their own programming
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.70,0:09:34.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and remarkably
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.07,0:09:36.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,a very large number of the original
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.80,0:09:38.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,two thousand are still in use
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.13,0:09:39.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,today twenty five years later
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.10,0:09:42.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the reason is that among other things
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.27,0:09:43.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,nervous systems and animals
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.53,0:09:44.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,haven't sped up in those years and
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.97,0:09:46.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so a computer that worked very well back
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.80,0:09:51.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,then for doing neurological experiments works very well today
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.93,0:09:55.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,somebody else was happening at lincoln labs in 1962
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.17,0:09:58.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and that was the invention of computer graphics
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.40,0:10:01.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,ivan's local and sketch pad
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.17,0:10:05.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,probably the most significant single thesis ever done
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.80,0:10:09.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,remarkable program in many ways even today as we'll see
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.30,0:10:10.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,by looking at this tape
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.40,0:10:18.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,this tape is from the very first movie
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.53,0:10:26.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,from the very first movie
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.57,0:10:30.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,of sketchkad taken in the summer
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.00,0:10:34.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,of nineteen sixty two so this is twenty five years old
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.73,0:10:38.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,rubber bands you're familiar with but look at what he's doing
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.07,0:10:39.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,he's pointing at the edges and saying
Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.40,0:10:41.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i want them to be all mutually perpendicular
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.67,0:10:43.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and sketchbad just figured out how to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:10:45.50,0:10:47.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,sketchbad is the first system to ever have a window
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.13,0:10:51.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,he's actually drawing on a virtual sheet of paper
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.97,0:10:53.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,about a third of a mile on his side
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.80,0:10:57.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,again to get something he wants he simply sketches it in roughly
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.57,0:10:59.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and then gives rules like be parallel
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.97,0:11:01.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and perpendicular
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.50,0:11:04.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and sketchbad figures out and solves the problems
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.57,0:11:07.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,here the rule is coloniarity
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.37,0:11:11.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so that the dash is right directly over the guidelines below
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.67,0:11:16.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,skepta was able to solve very complicated problems in real time
Dialogue: 0,0:11:17.97,0:11:22.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,involving both linear and non linear systems of constraints
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.30,0:11:26.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so was the first non procedural programming system
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.77,0:11:30.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and considerably more powerful in the spreadsheets of today
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.27,0:11:33.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so it's made a hole in the flange
Dialogue: 0,0:11:34.73,0:11:36.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,continuously zooms back
Dialogue: 0,0:11:37.87,0:11:39.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,now he wants to make a rivet
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.80,0:11:42.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and again we see why it's called sketch pad
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.27,0:11:45.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,he just draws a rough shape
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.90,0:11:51.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,uses the center of the crossbar there
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.27,0:11:54.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,as the center of the arc
Dialogue: 0,0:11:55.93,0:11:57.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and then points to the edges
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.87,0:12:01.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and says i want these to be usually perpendicular again
Dialogue: 0,0:12:02.53,0:12:04.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,solving that forces the crossbar to change
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.57,0:12:06.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,which forces the arc to change
Dialogue: 0,0:12:06.00,0:12:08.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,which gives you a perfectly symmetrical rivet
Dialogue: 0,0:12:12.33,0:12:15.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and he shows that how no matter how you distort it
Dialogue: 0,0:12:15.37,0:12:17.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,when he turns the problem solver on
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.00,0:12:19.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,it will come up with a symmetrical solution
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.77,0:12:21.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and he could have made it more complicated
Dialogue: 0,0:12:21.30,0:12:22.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,he could have constrained
Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.30,0:12:24.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the side lengths to be ratios of each other
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.17,0:12:27.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,or tied some other drawing in the
Dialogue: 0,0:12:28.27,0:12:29.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,environment
Dialogue: 0,0:12:35.73,0:12:39.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,another important idea seen here for practically the first time
Dialogue: 0,0:12:40.13,0:12:43.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is that of master drawings and instances
Dialogue: 0,0:12:43.60,0:12:45.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is working on a master drawing
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.10,0:12:49.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and what he has here now is an instance of that
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.40,0:12:54.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the instance can be rotated and scaled in position
Dialogue: 0,0:12:55.93,0:12:57.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so he's going to insert the river
Dialogue: 0,0:12:58.50,0:12:59.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,in the whole by the way
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.37,0:13:02.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the sketch dad was the first system in which it was
Dialogue: 0,0:13:02.70,0:13:03.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,definitely
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.67,0:13:06.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,discovered that the light pen is a very bad input device
Dialogue: 0,0:13:06.97,0:13:09.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,it's the blood runs out of your hand in about twenty seconds
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.47,0:13:10.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and leaves at num
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.87,0:13:11.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and in spite of that
Dialogue: 0,0:13:11.70,0:13:14.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,it's been re embedded at least ninety times in the last
Dialogue: 0,0:13:14.53,0:13:15.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,twenty five years
Dialogue: 0,0:13:16.70,0:13:18.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,here's another instance of the rivet another one
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.97,0:13:22.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the display is jumping around like that because this
Dialogue: 0,0:13:22.10,0:13:24.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,they didn't even really have computer displays back
Dialogue: 0,0:13:24.30,0:13:26.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,then the th two is putting up every
Dialogue: 0,0:13:27.53,0:13:29.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,got by brute force
Dialogue: 0,0:13:29.20,0:13:32.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,he didn't like the clasping so so he goes to the master drawing
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.10,0:13:33.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,makes them transparent
Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.00,0:13:36.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,rolling behold received dynamically
Dialogue: 0,0:13:36.30,0:13:39.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,that the rivets the instance rivets have felt that change
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.77,0:13:44.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so sketchpad is also the first object oriented software system
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.53,0:13:49.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i want to ask ivan sublim how could you possibly have

Dialogue: 0,0:24:43.17,0:24:45.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,you have to find the keyboard and so forth instead
Dialogue: 0,0:24:45.60,0:24:46.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,anglebart wanted to set it up
Dialogue: 0,0:24:46.87,0:24:49.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so that you would spend a relatively belong period of time

Dialogue: 0,0:24:51.80,0:24:54.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,you know you'd be typing a paragraph of text
Dialogue: 0,0:24:54.33,0:24:57.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,or you'd be doing lots of navigation and fixing

Dialogue: 0,0:25:00.37,0:25:01.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and so the fight

Dialogue: 0,0:25:03.67,0:25:04.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is a way of
Dialogue: 0,0:25:05.10,0:25:07.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,doing all the things that you could do with the keyboards
Dialogue: 0,0:25:07.17,0:25:09.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and you could stay for a very long time and never

Dialogue: 0,0:25:11.27,0:25:12.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and then the thing that they missed

Dialogue: 0,0:25:13.90,0:25:15.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,because of the inaccuracy of the analog

Dialogue: 0,0:25:21.87,0:25:25.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,where you indicate the object first and then give the command
Dialogue: 0,0:25:25.73,0:25:27.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,because the mouse was inaccurate what they would do in

Dialogue: 0,0:25:28.77,0:25:32.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,instead of just putting something like a word or a character

Dialogue: 0,0:25:33.60,0:25:35.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and then saying something like move
Dialogue: 0,0:25:36.17,0:25:39.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,or going to some drag icon they would have to go and say

Dialogue: 0,0:25:42.70,0:25:45.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,then wait for a mouse click to indicate which word
Dialogue: 0,0:25:45.30,0:25:47.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and by what you said to move like move word

Dialogue: 0,0:25:55.67,0:25:57.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,then after it had picked the object he
Dialogue: 0,0:25:57.47,0:25:59.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,then had to do a command except
Dialogue: 0,0:25:59.87,0:26:02.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so in order to move something you had to do

Dialogue: 0,0:26:10.87,0:26:13.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,kind of interesting paradox that sort of the way
Dialogue: 0,0:26:14.10,0:26:14.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,it does

Dialogue: 0,0:43:26.90,0:43:27.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so we brought in

Dialogue: 0,0:44:24.57,0:44:27.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,which was before you can buy it into stores was to actually

Dialogue: 0,0:44:34.00,0:44:35.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i took her about two weeks
Dialogue: 0,0:44:36.17,0:44:37.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,to do this and the
Dialogue: 0,0:44:37.93,0:44:39.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,size of the programming small talk
Dialogue: 0,0:44:39.53,0:44:41.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,seventy two was about a page long
Dialogue: 0,0:44:42.53,0:44:43.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so
Dialogue: 0,0:44:43.97,0:44:45.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,part of our aim
Dialogue: 0,0:44:45.33,0:44:49.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,here was not just to get people to be able to access things

Dialogue: 0,0:44:50.60,0:44:52.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,but also be able to do the equivalent of writing

Dialogue: 0,0:44:58.47,0:45:00.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,one of the things that is disturbingly true
Dialogue: 0,0:45:00.97,0:45:04.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,about most novices on computers is that
Dialogue: 0,0:45:04.90,0:45:07.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,about two pages of program is the maximum that i can handle
Dialogue: 0,0:45:07.73,0:45:09.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i like to be able to spread it out

Dialogue: 0,0:45:12.93,0:45:14.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,here's another example
Dialogue: 0,0:45:15.47,0:45:16.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,a fifteen year old boy
Dialogue: 0,0:45:16.73,0:45:18.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,again after a few months of programming in small talk
Dialogue: 0,0:45:18.97,0:45:19.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,seventy two
Dialogue: 0,0:45:21.20,0:45:23.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,he was interested in ham radio
Dialogue: 0,0:45:23.33,0:45:24.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,but really
Dialogue: 0,0:45:26.10,0:45:27.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,had gotten bored
Dialogue: 0,0:45:27.60,0:45:29.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,with the pdd m drawing radio diagram
Dialogue: 0,0:45:29.77,0:45:33.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so he decided to make himself a ham radio illustrator
Dialogue: 0,0:45:34.13,0:45:37.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,it has some quite sophisticated features you see here a

Dialogue: 0,0:45:39.50,0:45:42.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,with often use things like open and close dots
Dialogue: 0,0:45:42.93,0:45:44.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and it has a more extensive menu
Dialogue: 0,0:45:45.40,0:45:47.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,of iconic shapes
Dialogue: 0,0:45:47.37,0:45:50.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,for the circuits down below so you can pick up a

Dialogue: 0,0:45:56.33,0:46:00.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,but again this is also done in nineteen seventy five
Dialogue: 0,0:46:01.17,0:46:04.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and it's one of my favorite programs done by a child
Dialogue: 0,0:46:04.07,0:46:05.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,because less than ten years before this
Dialogue: 0,0:46:05.87,0:46:09.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,a phd had been awarded for a system that wasn't was good
Dialogue: 0,0:46:10.07,0:46:12.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,this program is about eighty lines in code law
Dialogue: 0,0:46:13.33,0:46:14.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,in the small top seven and two
Dialogue: 0,0:46:19.37,0:46:21.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,next we have a
Dialogue: 0,0:46:21.90,0:46:24.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,program done by adults
Dialogue: 0,0:46:24.77,0:46:26.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,but for the most part
Dialogue: 0,0:46:26.33,0:46:27.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,who had never programmed before
Dialogue: 0,0:46:27.80,0:46:30.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,they were professional animators that came to park
Dialogue: 0,0:46:30.07,0:46:31.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,in the summer of 74
Dialogue: 0,0:46:32.73,0:46:35.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and the thing that animators would like to do is to see what
Dialogue: 0,0:46:35.87,0:46:37.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,their animated animations gonna work before
Dialogue: 0,0:46:37.97,0:46:39.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,they have to go to film
Dialogue: 0,0:46:39.80,0:46:42.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so that summer they devised
Dialogue: 0,0:46:43.17,0:46:44.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,a variety of systems
Dialogue: 0,0:46:44.47,0:46:46.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and this is what every animator would like to do
Dialogue: 0,0:46:46.40,0:46:47.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is draw the picture
Dialogue: 0,0:46:49.67,0:46:52.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,reach over into the movie window grab the thing you just draw
Dialogue: 0,0:46:52.57,0:46:53.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and show it what to do
Dialogue: 0,0:46:55.40,0:46:56.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,have it play back
Dialogue: 0,0:47:01.00,0:47:01.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,now of course
Dialogue: 0,0:47:01.40,0:47:02.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,it's not squishing when it hit
Dialogue: 0,0:47:02.70,0:47:03.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so it doesn't look like real
Dialogue: 0,0:47:03.90,0:47:07.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so he wants to go to the steps there in the iconic menu
Dialogue: 0,0:47:11.80,0:47:14.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and when it gets down to the bottom here what is going to do
Dialogue: 0,0:47:14.00,0:47:15.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is replace that
Dialogue: 0,0:47:15.87,0:47:16.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,with a fresh drawing
Dialogue: 0,0:47:16.87,0:47:17.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,that's going to come from
Dialogue: 0,0:47:17.67,0:47:20.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,another transparent cell letting overlays
Dialogue: 0,0:47:20.27,0:47:22.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,in the drawing windows on the
Dialogue: 0,0:47:22.60,0:47:23.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,right hand side
Dialogue: 0,0:47:23.37,0:47:23.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so the
Dialogue: 0,0:47:23.93,0:47:26.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,drawing windows can have several transparent cells overlaid
Dialogue: 0,0:47:26.70,0:47:30.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,each other uses the old one for registration purposes
Dialogue: 0,0:47:30.67,0:47:32.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so he's now drawing on another
Dialogue: 0,0:47:33.90,0:47:36.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,cell and that drawing will be inserted into the animation
Dialogue: 0,0:47:36.80,0:47:38.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,as the animation goes
Dialogue: 0,0:47:39.50,0:47:41.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and now the animators will see
Dialogue: 0,0:47:41.17,0:47:43.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,how much detail he has to put into that
Dialogue: 0,0:47:44.00,0:47:46.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,squash drawing before
Dialogue: 0,0:47:46.13,0:47:47.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,we see it as actually squash
Dialogue: 0,0:47:47.70,0:47:50.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and the obviously has to at least put in the
Dialogue: 0,0:47:50.17,0:47:51.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,specular reflection
Dialogue: 0,0:47:52.17,0:47:53.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,on the ball
Dialogue: 0,0:47:57.17,0:48:00.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,there he goes now we see it as a declamation
Dialogue: 0,0:48:00.00,0:48:01.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,even though it's a one twenty change
Dialogue: 0,0:48:01.70,0:48:03.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,my program is about five pages long
Dialogue: 0,0:48:03.60,0:48:06.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,which is longer than children can actually do
Dialogue: 0,0:48:07.33,0:48:09.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,but here's a twelve year old girl
Dialogue: 0,0:48:13.27,0:48:15.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,it was very interested in forces
Dialogue: 0,0:48:18.53,0:48:19.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and so you spend some time
Dialogue: 0,0:48:19.90,0:48:21.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,getting the correct gate and animating a first
Dialogue: 0,0:48:21.93,0:48:23.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,across the screen
Dialogue: 0,0:48:26.27,0:48:29.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,then she wanted to feature that the adult animators had put in
Dialogue: 0,0:48:29.13,0:48:30.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and that was to be able to combine
Dialogue: 0,0:48:31.50,0:48:33.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,two animations into a single one

Dialogue: 0,0:52:17.73,0:52:19.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,we actually thought it through

Dialogue: 0,0:52:49.13,0:52:52.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i would say in english sentence like the following i'd say well

Dialogue: 0,0:53:04.13,0:53:06.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,that i said that you can understand everything about

Dialogue: 0,0:58:11.57,0:58:13.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and pointed into the tall thin one
Dialogue: 0,0:58:13.33,0:58:14.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the child said yes
Dialogue: 0,0:58:14.60,0:58:16.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,there's more water in the tall thin glass
Dialogue: 0,0:58:16.87,0:58:19.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and then blinner did something that psa hadn't thought to do
Dialogue: 0,0:58:19.77,0:58:21.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,brinner then covered up the glass
Dialogue: 0,0:58:23.10,0:58:23.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and the child said oh
Dialogue: 0,0:58:23.93,0:58:25.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,but wait there must be the same amount of water

Dialogue: 0,0:58:28.10,0:58:30.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and then bruner revealed the tall thing glass
Dialogue: 0,0:58:30.20,0:58:30.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and the child said oh
Dialogue: 0,0:58:30.93,0:58:32.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,wait no look there's more water
Dialogue: 0,0:58:33.90,0:58:36.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,bruner covered it up again and the child said oh

Dialogue: 0,0:58:44.00,0:58:46.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,this is a good way to do it because what blenner was doing was

Dialogue: 0,0:58:57.57,0:58:59.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so the child was normally
Dialogue: 0,0:59:00.00,0:59:03.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,visually dominant here but if you included the visual field
Dialogue: 0,0:59:03.33,0:59:04.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,then this fledgling

Dialogue: 0,1:10:06.40,1:10:07.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,well when i saw that
Dialogue: 0,1:10:07.73,1:10:09.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i said something akin to holy cow
Dialogue: 0,1:10:11.07,1:10:13.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so i just seen something that i wouldn't believe possible
Dialogue: 0,1:10:13.40,1:10:16.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and i realized that it applied very strongly
Dialogue: 0,1:10:16.50,1:10:19.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,to use your interface design that something
Dialogue: 0,1:10:19.37,1:10:20.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,really important
Dialogue: 0,1:10:20.30,1:10:23.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,had been was going on here so i got tim galway's book
Dialogue: 0,1:10:23.37,1:10:25.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the intergame of tennis and i read it
Dialogue: 0,1:10:25.73,1:10:28.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and a number of things that he said really stuck in my mind
Dialogue: 0,1:10:29.67,1:10:31.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,first one was almost a cliche
Dialogue: 0,1:10:31.57,1:10:34.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,he said learning happens when attention is focused
Dialogue: 0,1:10:34.57,1:10:36.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,but he was able to get something out of that
Dialogue: 0,1:10:38.20,1:10:40.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,because if you don't have a good theory of learning
Dialogue: 0,1:10:41.20,1:10:42.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,then you can still get it to happen
Dialogue: 0,1:10:42.87,1:10:44.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,by just helping the person
Dialogue: 0,1:10:44.07,1:10:46.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,focus one of the ways you can help a person focus
Dialogue: 0,1:10:46.77,1:10:48.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is by removing interference
Dialogue: 0,1:10:49.20,1:10:52.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and a lot of what you saw in that tape was a way of
Dialogue: 0,1:10:53.47,1:10:56.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,holding focus of the mentality that
Dialogue: 0,1:10:56.13,1:10:58.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,actually had to learn to play the tennis
Dialogue: 0,1:10:58.17,1:11:01.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and removing interference from the mentality that likes to talk
Dialogue: 0,1:11:01.47,1:11:03.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and make comments
Dialogue: 0,1:11:03.37,1:11:04.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,another thing that tim said that
Dialogue: 0,1:11:05.33,1:11:07.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,particularly stuck in my mind was
Dialogue: 0,1:11:07.90,1:11:10.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,said the problem with most theories of teaching
Dialogue: 0,1:11:10.70,1:11:12.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is that the parts of the body you want to have learned
Dialogue: 0,1:11:12.90,1:11:14.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,don't understand english
Dialogue: 0,1:11:15.17,1:11:16.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so the part of your
Dialogue: 0,1:11:16.30,1:11:19.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,mentality that understands english doesn't play tennis
Dialogue: 0,1:11:19.17,1:11:20.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,can't play tennis
Dialogue: 0,1:11:20.97,1:11:23.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,can't do mathematics it can't do music
Dialogue: 0,1:11:23.97,1:11:25.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,what it can do is talk and comment
Dialogue: 0,1:11:26.60,1:11:29.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and so in general for learning most things it is
Dialogue: 0,1:11:29.70,1:11:32.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,good to find a way of short circuiting
Dialogue: 0,1:11:32.37,1:11:34.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,that mentality that we think of is the eye
Dialogue: 0,1:11:34.53,1:11:36.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,that always tries to take over
Dialogue: 0,1:11:37.30,1:11:40.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and finally kim made a very interesting observation
Dialogue: 0,1:11:40.97,1:11:43.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and that is that the problem with being a beginner
Dialogue: 0,1:11:44.33,1:11:47.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is that you get a lot of practice in staying a beginner
Dialogue: 0,1:11:48.47,1:11:50.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so a beginning tennis player
Dialogue: 0,1:11:50.60,1:11:53.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,most of the time is does chase the ball
Dialogue: 0,1:11:54.27,1:11:55.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,they get to be really good at chasing the ball
Dialogue: 0,1:11:55.90,1:11:58.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,but all other forms of tennis involve hitting the ball
Dialogue: 0,1:11:59.13,1:12:01.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so it's very important for tim to find a way of
Dialogue: 0,1:12:01.93,1:12:05.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,catapulting anybody learning tennis like molly there
Dialogue: 0,1:12:05.67,1:12:07.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,out of the chaser ball
Dialogue: 0,1:12:08.10,1:12:10.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,stage and instantly get into hitting the ball stage
Dialogue: 0,1:12:10.53,1:12:12.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so you had to find a way of getting a person
Dialogue: 0,1:12:12.73,1:12:14.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,who would never pick up a tennis racket
Dialogue: 0,1:12:14.27,1:12:15.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,before to be able to hit the ball
Dialogue: 0,1:12:16.27,1:12:18.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,ninety eight percent of the time they swung at it
Dialogue: 0,1:12:18.87,1:12:21.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,we realized that was an incredibly important principle
Dialogue: 0,1:12:21.37,1:12:22.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,for user interface design
Dialogue: 0,1:12:22.77,1:12:26.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,why spent two weeks trying to read an ms dos

Dialogue: 0,1:12:29.40,1:12:32.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,or open up in application why do any of those things
Dialogue: 0,1:12:33.00,1:12:34.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,what do you get from it
Dialogue: 0,1:12:34.33,1:12:36.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,much better to find a way of
Dialogue: 0,1:12:36.93,1:12:38.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,designing the user interface
Dialogue: 0,1:12:38.10,1:12:39.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so that the person who uses it
Dialogue: 0,1:12:39.50,1:12:41.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,acts like an intermediate from the first
Dialogue: 0,1:12:41.30,1:12:42.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,first time that they sit down
Dialogue: 0,1:12:42.87,1:12:46.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and then they get into a process that is rewarding in itself
Dialogue: 0,1:12:50.10,1:12:51.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,now these ideas
Dialogue: 0,1:12:52.13,1:12:53.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,work beautifully for music
Dialogue: 0,1:12:53.60,1:12:58.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and they also apply in cognitive areas very strongly here's
Dialogue: 0,1:12:59.50,1:13:03.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,an example of a programming problem and that is
Dialogue: 0,1:13:03.87,1:13:05.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,let's take the logo
Dialogue: 0,1:13:05.10,1:13:08.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,turtle and write a program to draw a circle
Dialogue: 0,1:13:10.50,1:13:11.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and we'll do it
Dialogue: 0,1:13:12.47,1:13:13.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,with
Dialogue: 0,1:13:14.47,1:13:16.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,three ages of people a five year old
Dialogue: 0,1:13:16.33,1:13:18.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,a ten year old and a fifteen year old
Dialogue: 0,1:13:18.70,1:13:20.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,as representatives from these three
Dialogue: 0,1:13:22.33,1:13:25.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,mental mentality dominant areas the body
Dialogue: 0,1:13:26.30,1:13:26.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the visual
Dialogue: 0,1:13:26.93,1:13:31.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and the symbolic now the way you do a get a five year old to
Dialogue: 0,1:13:32.13,1:13:34.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,to do a picture to do a circle
Dialogue: 0,1:13:34.50,1:13:36.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,there's something that's more paporate learning long ago
Dialogue: 0,1:13:36.37,1:13:38.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and that is you tell the five year old close your eyes
Dialogue: 0,1:13:40.37,1:13:41.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and make a circle with your body
Dialogue: 0,1:13:44.57,1:13:46.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,if they had gone part way around
Dialogue: 0,1:13:46.87,1:13:48.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,you say well what were you doing
Dialogue: 0,1:13:49.20,1:13:50.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and the five year old says well
Dialogue: 0,1:13:50.33,1:13:53.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i was going a little and turning a little over and over again
Dialogue: 0,1:13:53.47,1:13:55.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,if you type that into logo
Dialogue: 0,1:13:55.90,1:13:58.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,you get a perfect circle
Dialogue: 0,1:13:58.30,1:13:59.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and that's because the five year old
Dialogue: 0,1:13:59.60,1:14:01.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,knows differential equations
Dialogue: 0,1:14:02.53,1:14:03.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,because the circle is particularly
Dialogue: 0,1:14:03.73,1:14:05.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,simple thing in differential geometry
Dialogue: 0,1:14:05.77,1:14:08.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,which is only discovered about a hundred and fifty years ago
Dialogue: 0,1:14:08.00,1:14:09.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,by carl gauss
Dialogue: 0,1:14:09.80,1:14:12.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so a circle is that thing that has constant curvature
Dialogue: 0,1:14:12.57,1:14:14.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so the change in curvature is zero
Dialogue: 0,1:14:14.87,1:14:16.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and the trial's
Dialogue: 0,1:14:17.40,1:14:18.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,body mentality
Dialogue: 0,1:14:19.87,1:14:21.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,doing mentality
Dialogue: 0,1:14:21.57,1:14:23.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,understands that kind of geometry
Dialogue: 0,1:14:24.33,1:14:27.00,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so the five year old comes up with a very simple program that
Dialogue: 0,1:14:27.00,1:14:28.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,produces an elegant circle
Dialogue: 0,1:14:28.87,1:14:30.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the ten year old has a harder time
Dialogue: 0,1:14:30.50,1:14:31.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,because a ten year old is visual
Dialogue: 0,1:14:32.30,1:14:33.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and really wants to look at things
Dialogue: 0,1:14:33.60,1:14:35.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,he doesn't want to do things with his body
Dialogue: 0,1:14:35.40,1:14:36.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so much anymore
Dialogue: 0,1:14:37.27,1:14:39.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and so he wants to draw circles with a compass
Dialogue: 0,1:14:40.47,1:14:41.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and after a while
Dialogue: 0,1:14:41.60,1:14:42.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,he'll see that
Dialogue: 0,1:14:43.53,1:14:44.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,by drawing lots of circles
Dialogue: 0,1:14:44.60,1:14:45.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,you'll see that the main thing
Dialogue: 0,1:14:45.70,1:14:47.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,about drawing circles with the compass
Dialogue: 0,1:14:47.37,1:14:48.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,is that the points on
Dialogue: 0,1:14:48.27,1:14:50.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the rim were always the same distance from the center
Dialogue: 0,1:14:51.60,1:14:54.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so his turtle program picks the pen up

Dialogue: 0,1:18:32.13,1:18:35.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,because it can do inferencing that is not open to these other

Dialogue: 0,1:18:36.47,1:18:38.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,we thought that the right slogan would be

Dialogue: 0,1:18:42.47,1:18:45.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the way we did it was to say well

Dialogue: 0,1:18:57.00,1:19:00.30,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,but because it involves a kinesthetic sense
Dialogue: 0,1:19:00.30,1:19:02.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and the kinesthetic sense is the one that knows where you are

Dialogue: 0,1:25:52.40,1:25:55.27,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,instead of crashing the system what we'll do get
Dialogue: 0,1:25:55.27,1:25:56.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,as a notification
Dialogue: 0,1:25:58.90,1:26:04.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,here that the string couldn't transform itself into an integer
Dialogue: 0,1:26:05.70,1:26:08.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,here we can look and see what was going on at that time
Dialogue: 0,1:26:09.20,1:26:10.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so all of the
Dialogue: 0,1:26:10.57,1:26:12.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,processing that was being done
Dialogue: 0,1:26:12.13,1:26:14.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and that thread of control was set aside
Dialogue: 0,1:26:15.30,1:26:16.40,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,in small talk
Dialogue: 0,1:26:17.10,1:26:18.07,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,in fact once
Dialogue: 0,1:26:19.53,1:26:21.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,people looked on the disc and found seventeen

Dialogue: 0,1:26:30.50,1:26:34.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,we got a picture of things that were happening in that process
Dialogue: 0,1:26:35.93,1:26:39.37,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,quite independently of the processes and small talk that are

Dialogue: 0,1:26:42.27,1:26:44.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so here's the code that was executing
Dialogue: 0,1:26:47.20,1:26:49.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,here's the attempt of the string to make itself into an imager
Dialogue: 0,1:26:49.97,1:26:50.77,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,that failed
Dialogue: 0,1:26:53.10,1:26:55.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,couldn't do that because it couldn't find any

Dialogue: 0,1:26:58.30,1:27:01.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and here are the parameters there's the argument
Dialogue: 0,1:27:03.17,1:27:06.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,self is the thing that got the message so that's three
Dialogue: 0,1:27:08.67,1:27:10.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and so we get to see all of the
Dialogue: 0,1:27:11.53,1:27:13.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,things we could single step it if we wished
Dialogue: 0,1:27:14.77,1:27:17.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,we can restart it if we wished and so forth
Dialogue: 0,1:27:19.07,1:27:19.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so
Dialogue: 0,1:27:21.07,1:27:21.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the whole idea

Dialogue: 0,1:27:27.10,1:27:30.20,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,comes back to this question that i asked in the very beginning
Dialogue: 0,1:27:30.47,1:27:34.13,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and that is what would a computer be if it were like a pencil

Dialogue: 0,1:27:41.40,1:27:45.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,how low can we go to childhood
Dialogue: 0,1:27:46.77,1:27:49.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,can we go into much much much lower
Dialogue: 0,1:27:50.30,1:27:51.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,than grade school
Dialogue: 0,1:27:51.77,1:27:53.90,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,here's an answer to that question
Dialogue: 0,1:27:55.33,1:27:57.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,it's a tape i got from

Dialogue: 0,1:28:11.27,1:28:12.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and she's never lived in a world
Dialogue: 0,1:28:12.80,1:28:15.53,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,that wasn't densely populated with macintoshes
Dialogue: 0,1:28:16.33,1:28:18.70,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,because both your mother and father worked at home

Dialogue: 0,1:28:23.27,1:28:23.73,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and in fact
Dialogue: 0,1:28:23.73,1:28:25.67,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,when i found that the little girl was interested in computers
Dialogue: 0,1:28:25.67,1:28:27.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i gave her an apple ii which she rejected
Dialogue: 0,1:28:28.80,1:28:31.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,she wanted a macintosh just like her folks
Dialogue: 0,1:28:31.20,1:28:33.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,and she literally learned to use it

Dialogue: 0,1:28:37.10,1:28:37.97,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,so for this child
Dialogue: 0,1:28:37.97,1:28:40.80,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the macintosh is not a piece of technology but simply
Dialogue: 0,1:28:41.30,1:28:44.10,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,more material in the environment to manipulate

Dialogue: 0,1:41:10.20,1:41:13.47,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,renewal i think is a very special word word and
Dialogue: 0,1:41:13.93,1:41:16.87,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i like to use it instead of education
Dialogue: 0,1:41:17.90,1:41:21.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,education has strong connotations but i think renewal

Dialogue: 0,1:41:33.50,1:41:35.93,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i find as i get older it is harder and harder
Dialogue: 0,1:41:36.90,1:41:39.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,to see things from a fresh point of view and so for me
Dialogue: 0,1:41:39.67,1:41:42.17,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,the kinds of things i need to do are to
Dialogue: 0,1:41:42.57,1:41:45.33,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,for instance be able to do more music
Dialogue: 0,1:41:45.57,1:41:46.60,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,i used to be a professional

Dialogue: 0,1:41:54.13,1:41:57.50,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,that my ideas are fresher in the computer science domain
Dialogue: 0,1:41:57.80,1:41:59.57,*Default,NTP,0000,0000,0000,,otherwise there's a tendency to just
